<h2>MECHANICAL AIDS</h2>

<h3>IN THE TREATMENTS OF</h3>

<h1>CHRONIC DISEASES.</h1>


<p>We have, in different parts of this work, referred to a large variety of
ingeniously devised machinery and apparatus employed at the Invalids' Hotel
and Surgical Institute, in the treatment of chronic diseases. Although we
can, on paper, give but a meagre idea of the variety and adaptability of
these valuable mechanical appliances, yet we will endeavor to illustrate
and explain a few of our machines for the application of transmitted
motion.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise703"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 1. The Manipulator. " src="images/advise703.png" /></a><br />Fig. 1.
The Manipulator. </p>

<p>Fig. 1 represents a machine, called the Manipulator, which transmits
motion through suitable attachments, which are adjustable by means of the
ratchet <i>G</i>, so as to reach all parts of the body. It is equally
available for applying motion to the head, feet, or any intermediate part
of the body.</p>

<p><a name="Page_907" id="Page_907"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
907]</span><i>B, B</i> are rubbing attachments, with two opposing elastic,
adherent surfaces, between which an arm or a leg may be included. These
have alternate reciprocating action from the rock-shaft <i>H</i>, and are
made to approach each other, and press the included part at the will of the
patient. This is sometimes called the double-rubber, and is made detachable
if desired.</p>

<p><i>A</i> is the lever, by which the two parts of the double-rubber are
made to compress the arm or leg.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise704"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 2. Manipulator Extended." src="images/advise704.png" /></a><br />Fig.
2. Manipulator Extended.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise705"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 3. Manipulator Folded." src="images/advise705.png" /></a><br />Fig. 3.
Manipulator Folded.</p>

<p><i>D</i> is a single attachment for rubbing. It may be connected at
either side of the machine, so as to present the rubbing surface in four
different directions, as may be most convenient. It will act
perpendicularly, horizontally, or diagonally, and from below or from above
the part receiving the action, according to requirements. The shank of the
rubber may have any special form to suit special cases.</p>

<p><i>C</i> is the <i>foot holder.</i> It communicates to the leg the
semi-rotary or oscillating motion of the rock-shaft. It may be attached to
either end of the rock-shaft.</p>

<p><i>E</i> is the <i>hand holder,</i> which, grasped by the hand,
communicates motion to the arm, shoulder, and chest; or the hand <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_908" id="Page_908"></a>[pg 908]</span>may be
inserted passively, when the effect of motion is more confined to the hand
and fore-arm.</p>

<p>In the position shown in Fig. 2, by means of the single rubber
attachment, the manipulator acts upon the upper portion of the trunk, neck,
head, and arms; by means of the hand-holder, upon the arms; by means of the
double-rubber, upon the arms, shoulders, and scalp.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise706"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 4. Rubbing the Arms." src="images/advise706.png" /></a><br />Fig. 4.
Rubbing the Arms.</p>

<p>When the acting part or head is lowered to its extreme limit, the
machine occupies the least space. In this position, by means of the
foot-holder it communicates oscillation to the legs; by means of the
single-rubber, it acts upon the feet, ankles, and lower leg; by means of
the double-rubber, it acts upon the legs, including the feet, the patient
either sitting or lying.</p>

<p>In all of these applications of motion, energy travels from inanimate to
animate matter; non-vital contributes to vital energy: and the various
processes through which vital power is developed are promoted and carried
forward in a degree till the point which constitutes health is
attained.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise707"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 5. Rubbing the Legs." src="images/advise707.png" /></a><br />Fig. 5.
Rubbing the Legs.</p>

<p>The name, <i>Manipulator</i>, is very naturally applied to the
instrument, the action of which resembles so much that of the living
operator. It is, however, impossible for the unaided hand to impart the
degree of rapidity necessary to secure the effects easily attained by this
machine; and, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_909"
id="Page_909"></a>[pg 909]</span>practically, restoration is often secured
in cases in which it is quite unattainable by any other remedial agent.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise708"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 6. Rubbing the Chest and Abdomen." src="images/advise708.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 6. Rubbing the Chest and Abdomen.</p>

<p>Motion, transmitted by the manipulator, exerts a curative effect in
<i>all</i> chronic affections, and is not limited, as is sometimes
supposed, to paralytic affections and deformities. In these latter
affections it is a great assistance in effecting a cure; while, in chronic
affections, whatever the local symptoms, it supplies the additional energy
which is indispensable for recovery in all diseases of long standing.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise709"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 7. Rubbing the Back." src="images/advise709.png" /></a><br />Fig. 7.
Rubbing the Back.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Operation</i>.&mdash;Fig. 4 represents the manipulator in
operation. The machine is propelled by steam power at the Invalids' Hotel
and Surgical Institute, but may be worked by hand, as here represented. One
arm is inserted between the double-rubbing pads, which are raised to about
the height of the shoulders, the patient being seated at the side of the
machine; the other hand is placed on the lever, and as much pressure is
applied as is perfectly agreeable, care being taken to diminish the
pressure at any part which is unusually sensitive. All portions of the arm
from the shoulder down are successively included in the rubbers, while a
suitable degree of reciprocating or rubbing action is obtained by giving
motion to the wheel.</p>

<p>To apply the same operation to the other arm, the patient <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_910" id="Page_910"></a>[pg 910]</span>may
either turn in his seat or change his position to the opposite side of the
machine.</p>

<p>If any portion of the extremity is affected with inflammation or
swelling, it is necessary to apply the action described to the whole of the
unaffected portion first; after this the affected part may be beneficially
operated on, provided that the sensations are strictly heeded, and that it
is so managed that only a comfortable feeling is produced.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise710"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 8. Oscillating the Arms and Chest." src="images/advise710.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 8. Oscillating the Arms and Chest.</p>

<p>In Fig. 5, the patient is so seated beside the machine that he can
insert one thigh between the pads of the rubber, and also control the lever
with the hand. It is sometimes more convenient to suspend a movable weight
from the lever. While the machine is running, he can withdraw the leg
gradually, as each portion receives its proper amount of action, till the
whole, including the foot, becomes glowing with the effect. The boot or
shoe affords no impediment to the effect, and should remain on.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise711"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 9. Oscillating the Legs." src="images/advise711.png" /></a><br />Fig.
9. Oscillating the Legs.</p>

<p>Sometimes, especially in the beginning, or when the feet are habitually
cold, it is better to apply the action only from the knees down.</p>

<p>The rubbing-pad (d) may be attached to either side of the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_911" id="Page_911"></a>[pg
911]</span>machine, according to convenience or effect sought. The action
derived from the right end of the rock-shaft is much less severe than that
from the left, on account of the shape of the rubber appendage, and at the
beginning should be used in preference. In Fig. 6, the patient sits on an
ordinary stool, or, if feeble, in a chair, and presents any portion of the
chest or abdomen to the action of the rubber. The instrument is raised or
lowered to suit convenience, while the patient gently presses portions of
the trunk successively upon the rubbing-pad. The degree of the effect is
thus always under the absolute control of the one receiving the action.
This operation, like the preceding, produces great heat, reddens the skin,
relieves pain, and greatly stimulates the functions, not only of the skin,
but of the organs contained in the cavities of the chest and the
abdomen.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise712"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 10. Vibrator operated by Manipulator." src="images/advise712.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 10. Vibrator operated by Manipulator.</p>

<p>The same operation may be applied also to the legs while the patient is
standing.</p>

<p>In Fig. 7, the back is presented to the action of the rubbing-pad. The
action will, if desired, be made to reach from the neck to the hips, and
even to the thighs. All sensitive portions of the back should at first be
omitted, in order that they may be benefited by the counter-irritation or
drawing away of the blood. This is easily produced by those familiar with
the use of the machine. The rubbing of the back should be deferred till the
close of each application, in order that the spinal centers may be relieved
of hyper&aelig;mia, or excess of blood.</p>

<p><a name="Page_912" id="Page_912"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
912]</span>The machine, as represented by Fig. 8, is brought to the desired
elevation, about as high as the shoulders, and the hand-holder is attached.
One arm is extended horizontally, and the hand grasps the hand-holder,
while rapid motion is given by turning the wheel. An alternate twisting
motion is communicated to the arm, which causes corresponding pressure and
relaxation of all the soft tissues of the limb, combined with slight
rubbing or attrition. The action is increased by contracting the muscles,
and also by grasping at greater distance from the center. Both hands may
grasp at the same time, or the two sides may receive the motion in turn.
The effect is similar to that of the rubbing before described, but it is
less limited; by grasping firmly, it may extend to the whole chest.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise713"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 11. Vibrating Kneader." src="images/advise713.png" /></a><br />Fig.
11. Vibrating Kneader.</p>

<p>The foot-holder is attached, as shown in Fig. 9, and brought by the
means before described to a position to receive one foot at a comfortable
elevation, the leg being extended, while the patient is seated in an
ordinary chair in an easy position. The action is precisely like that above
described as applied to the arm, and extends to the thigh and pelvis. If
the knee is slightly flexed, the action is almost entirely confined to the
lower leg. Each leg may be operated on in turn.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Applying Mechanical Movements to Very Feeble
Invalids</i>.&mdash;Experience demonstrates that no degree of feebleness
excludes the beneficial use of these operations. Invalids <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_913" id="Page_913"></a>[pg 913]</span>too
weak to stand, or able to help themselves in the least degree are often
treated with perfect success. A judicious use of the Manipulator
<i>always</i> increases nutrition and strength without any fatigue or
exhaustion, however feeble the patient may be. It is only necessary to
provide for these cases additional conveniences, so that the applications
can be made in the recumbent position, and also that proper intervals of
rest be allowed between successive operations. For this purpose couches are
provided, each containing a certain portion of the Manipulator. These are
operated by means of a short connecting-rod, joining the rock-shafts of the
two pieces of mechanism, as shown in Fig. 10. The Vibrator has two small
discs, or heads acting through an opening in the couch on which the invalid
rests. These impinge with a rapid, direct stroke upon the portion of the
body exposed to the action. The top of the couch is adjustable, and is
quickly placed at the elevation which secures the proper force of the
instrument, as shown in Fig 11. By simply turning and moving the body, the
patient brings any part in contact with the vibrating discs. The cut
represents the Vibrator, in which the force impinges at right angles with
the surface of the body, sending waves of motion through its substance.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise714"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 12. Apparatus for the Rubbing in a Recumbent Position."
src="images/advise714.png" /></a><br />Fig. 12. Apparatus for the Rubbing
in a Recumbent Position.</p>

<p>The rubbing which is shown in Figs. 4 and 5 may be applied to all parts
of the body in a recumbent position. A couch is required of similar
construction to the vibrating couch, but with a rubbing-pad instead of
vibrating heads acting through the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_914"
id="Page_914"></a>[pg 914]</span>opening and operated by appropriate
connections, as shown in Fig. 12. The top is adjustable, and the degree of
effect desired is capable of easy regulation. The patient turns different
portions of the body to the action of the rubber as required.</p>

<p><b>Kneading</b>. Kneading is a process applied chiefly to the abdomen.
The purpose of this operation is to increase nutrition, the muscular power
and action of the abdominal walls, and the function of the organs which
they contain. Three modes of applying this operation by the mechanical
apparatus are in use, effected by the Direct, the Rotary, and the Revolving
Kneader.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise715"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 13. Apparatus for Rotary Kneading." src="images/advise715.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 13. Apparatus for Rotary Kneading.</p>

<p><b>The Direct Kneader</b>. This resembles in form and action the
vibrating instrument shown in Fig. 11. The impinging heads, however, are
made broader, the motion greater in extent, and the rate of motion less
than one-tenth of that employed for the purpose of vibrating. This slowness
of motion seems to increase the action of the muscles.</p>

<p><b>The Rotary Kneader</b>. The action of the kneading heads in this form
of apparatus, as shown in Fig. 13, is <i>inward</i> and <i>upward</i>
alternately, and it is eminently well calculated to stimulate the action of
the abdominal organs.</p>

<p><b>The Revolving Kneader</b>. In the form of kneading apparatus, shown
in Fig. 14, two thick rollers, which move freely on axes at the extremities
of arms, projecting on either <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_915"
id="Page_915"></a>[pg 915]</span>side of a shaft turned by a crank or belt,
are made to act alternately upon each side of the abdomen.</p>

<p>In the methods of kneading above described, the degree of force acting
on the body is governed by an arrangement for elevating or depressing the
upholstered top of the couch upon which the patient rests, and through
which the action is transmitted to the body.</p>

<p>If this form of apparatus is driven at a rate ten times more rapidly
than is desired for kneading, the effect is vibratory, and it is, in fact,
used for that purpose.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise716"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 14. Apparatus for Kneading with Rollers." src="images/advise716.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 14. Apparatus for Kneading with Rollers.</p>


<h3>THE CURE OF SWELLINGS AND TUMORS.</h3>


<p>The application of motion through the Manipulator promotes absorption,
and thus all kinds of <i>swellings</i> and non-malignant <i>tumors</i> are
made to diminish under its use. In these cases the vessels of the affected
part are distended with stagnant blood, and a portion of the fluid passes
through their walls, distending the surrounding tissues, which become more
or less hardened. By the transmission of active motion to the affected
parts, the contents of the vessels are urged forward; the outside fluids
are thus permitted to return to the general circulation and become subject
to the energetic vital action of the general system, local deficiencies of
oxidation being increased to the normal degree, causing destruction of
morbid matter and giving place for new <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_916" id="Page_916"></a>[pg 916]</span>and wholesome nutritive
materials for vital use. In short, normal functional activity is
established, both locally and generally. Scrofulous, dropsical, rheumatic,
and other local accumulations disappear, and even tumors are dispersed, by
the use of the Manipulator, in cases in which the knife would otherwise be
required.</p>


<h3>COUNTER-IRRITATION AND REVULSION.</h3>


<p>Artificial means have always been employed to produce an energetic flow
of blood in different parts of the body, thereby relieving morbid
distention of the vessels, and consequent irritation and pain in
neighboring parts. Cupping, hot applications, mustard, capsicum, blisters,
and other irritants, are resorted to, but their effects, while generally
very good in acute cases, are too transient to be of material aid in
chronic affections. By the use of the Manipulator, we can produce the most
thorough revulsive effects, operating upon large surfaces, and causing
large masses of muscle to receive an increased amount of blood, thus
drawing it away from parts oppressed by too great a supply, constituting
engorgement. No injury is done to the parts acted upon; on the contrary,
they are strengthened by the application, which can be repeated as often as
necessary till relief is permanent. Thus, the head, heart, digestive
organs, liver, chest, or whatever part is oppressed by excess of blood, may
be speedily and permanently relieved. By means of this ability to relieve
any part of the system from engorgement, and consequent inflammation and
its results, are we enabled to permanently cure a large variety of chronic
inflammatory, ulcerative, and nervous affections.</p>

<p>Local inflammations by this method of treatment may be speedily
cured.</p>


<h3>CURE OF NEURALGIA.</h3>


<p>By the transmission of motion through the Manipulator and other
ingeniously devised apparatus and machinery, we increase the functional
power and activity of the muscles, and thereby diminish morbid sensibility
of the nerves, which is present in neuralgia. Prolonged and excessive
nervous action is attended with too great a rush of blood to the
nerve-centers, which can <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_917"
id="Page_917"></a>[pg 917]</span>only be relieved by increasing the flow in
the muscles. Congestion, or hyper&aelig;mia, in the spinal cord or brain, or
both, is a condition ever present in neuralgia. The application of motion
through the manipulator causes the blood to flow to the muscles, thus
relieving nervous congestion and consequent neuralgia.</p>


<h3>CURE OF PARALYSIS.</h3>


<p>In no single disease has the transmission of motion through the
Manipulator proved more thoroughly efficacious than in <i>paralysis</i>.
The most prominent requirements in these cases seem to be the
following:</p>

<p>Excess of blood in the brain and spinal cord needs to be removed and
diverted to parts in which it will be useful instead of obstructive.</p>

<p>The contractile power of the capillaries should be improved.</p>

<p>The quality of nutritive fluids should be improved by the promotion of
oxidation through increased circulation.</p>

<p>These and many more wants of disordered nerves, are readily supplied by
transmitted motion.</p>

<p>The Manipulator combines, in a single ingenious mechanical contrivance,
the several movements best adapted for the promotion of healthy functional
activity.</p>


<h3>CURE OF DEFORMITIES.</h3>


<p>"Deformities arising from <i>paralysis and contractions of muscles and
tendons</i>, producing stiffened joints and distorted limbs, are of common
occurrence. A rational explanation of the wonderful curative results which
follow the employment of transmitted motion in these cases may not be
without interest to the reader. The muscles are composed of <i>bundles</i>
of little fibers which glide upon one another in every movement. Another
set of fibers called <i>connective tissue</i>, holds the fibers together in
bundles or separate muscles, and interlaces and crosses them in every
direction. Now, if these fibers remain long in a fixed position, or are
involved in inflammation, there is danger of adhesions forming between
them, producing permanent immobility; gliding movements are interfered
with, and the muscle ceases to perform its function. Inflammation <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_918" id="Page_918"></a>[pg 918]</span>gives
rise to effusion, or the formation of a kind of cement which binds together
the muscular fibers and prevents motion.</p>

<p>Rubbing, kneading, and actively manipulating the affected parts with
that intensity of administration secured by the manipulator, rends asunder
and breaks up these minute adhesions, re-establishing gliding motions,
causes absorption of effused materials, and restores the affected part to a
normal condition.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise717"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 15. Muscular fibre highly magnified." src="images/advise717.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 15. Muscular fibre highly magnified.</p>

<p>The deformed limb is straightened by the filling out of the
muscle-cells, and increasing the length and also the nutrition of the
affected muscles. No pulling or <i>forced extension</i> is required.
Deformity ceases when the conditions upon which it depends are removed by
rational appliances, which are always agreeable. No brace, splints, or
other confining appliances are necessary, except in rare cases in which the
bones are very badly distorted.</p>

<p>In withered and deformed limbs, resulting from infantile paralysis, the
manipulator furnishes the most agreeable, direct, and certain remedy. It
restores nutrition, sensation, and power, and dispenses almost wholly with
mechanical supports. Club-feet, wry neck, spinal curvature, hip-joint
disease, white swellings, and stiffened joints, are all readily amendable
to the curative effects of motion administered by the manipulator and other
machinery.</p>

<p>Contracted and shortened muscles are gradually lengthened by vigorous,
long-continued, and frequently repeated rubbing with the manipulator across
their longitudinal fibers; bound-down and confined tendons are liberated
and normal movements established.</p>


<h3>DISEASES OF WOMEN.</h3>


<p>Uterine and ovarian congestion, chronic inflammation, discharges, morbid
enlargement, prolapsus, anteversion and retroversion, anteflexion and
retroflexion, and other derangements of the womb and its appendages, are
radically cured by the vibratory, rubbing, kneading, and other movements,
administered <a name="Page_919" id="Page_919"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
919]</span>through the manipulator and other mechanical appliances employed
at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.</p>

<p>To those who are tired of taking medicine, this mode of treatment
commends itself as being both agreeable and efficient. There is no case too
weak, nervous, or helpless for the use of this curative agent. It is
entirely devoid of objectionable features, being <i>always applied outside
the clothing</i>.</p>

<p><b>Cause of Female Weakness</b>. The true relations of cause and effect
are very liable to be misunderstood, when considering the various diseases
incident to the organs contained in the female pelvis. Treatment intended
to be remedial is therefore very often misdirected and fails to afford
relief, positive injury frequently resulting instead. When the nature of
these diseases is properly understood, their cure can be effected with
comparative ease.</p>

<p>These diseases are always attended with weakness, which is often very
great, of the muscles that hold the diseased organs in position. The
muscles forming the walls of the abdomen, and the diaphragm, or midriff,
all of which are concerned in the act of respiration, become feeble and
only partially perform their functions. In health, they act constantly,
even during sleep, producing a rhythmical movement, which is communicated
to the contents of the abdominal and pelvic cavities. This motion promotes
a healthy circulation in the parts. In almost all affections of the pelvic
organs, this normal condition is greatly diminished.</p>

<p>Diminution of the motions of respiration is attended with an increase of
the amount of the blood in the pelvic organs, constituting an engorgement
of the parts, called congestion, or inflammation. This gives rise to
enlargement of the womb, ulcerations, tumors, and a multitude of kindred
secondary effects, usually considered as the primary disease and treated as
such. The contents of the cavity of the trunk, weighing several pounds, are
allowed to gravitate down and rest upon the contents of the pelvis, forcing
the congested uterus and ovaries down out of their natural positions, and
often bending or tipping the womb in various directions. A long list of
symptoms follows as the natural consequence of these abnormal
conditions.</p>

<p><b>Rational Treatment</b>. Ovarian congestion and inflammation, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_920" id="Page_920"></a>[pg
920]</span>inflammation of the uterus, ulceration of this organ, deranged
menstruation, leucorrhea with the attendant pain, nervousness, and other
derangements depending upon loss of supporting power in the abdominal
muscles, all result from loss of the <i>natural</i> motions of respiration,
and consequent deranged circulation. These several conditions can be cured
by removing their cause. When the power of the parts involved in the
weakness is restored, all these morbid conditions disappear. Judicious
cultivation of power in the weakened supports is attended with certain
curative results. This is best accomplished by mechanical motion, by which
the normal circulation is restored, inflammations and congestions are
subdued, displacements corrected, ulcers healed, and functional activity is
re-established.</p>


<h3>RECAPITULATION.</h3>


<p>Motion properly transmitted to the human system by mechanical apparatus
is transformed into other forms of force identical with vital energy, by
which the ordinary processes of the system are greatly promoted.</p>

<p>It increases animal heat and nervous and muscular power to the normal
standard.</p>

<p>It removes engorgement or local impediments to the circulation.</p>

<p>The electrical induction produced renders it a most efficacious remedy
for paralysis of all kinds.</p>

<p>It removes interstitial fluids and causes rapid absorption and
disappearance of solid and fluid accumulations.</p>

<p>It is a powerful alterative, or blood-purifier, increasing oxidation and
stimulating excretion.</p>

<p>It diminishes chronic nervous irritability and promotes sleep.</p>

<p>Deformities are easily cured without the cutting of tendons, or use of
mechanical supports.</p>

<p>It hardens the flesh by increasing muscular development and improves
digestion and nutrition.</p>

<p>Dr. R.V. PIERCE, having acquired a world-wide reputation in the treatment
of Chronic Diseases, resulting in a professional business far exceeding his
individual ability to conduct, some years ago induced several medical
gentlemen of high professional standing to associate themselves with him,
as the Faculty of the World's Dispensary and Surgical Institute, the
Consulting Department of which has since been merged into the Invalids'
Hotel. The organization is duly incorporated under a statute enacted by the
Legislature of the State of New York, and under the name and style of the
"WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION," of which Dr. PIERCE is President,
and in the affairs of which he will, as heretofore, take an active and

<h3>IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.</h3>

<p>Dr. R.V.PIERCE, having in the Fall of 1880 resigned his seat in
Congress, has since been able to devote his whole time and attention to the
interests of the Association, and those consulting our Medical and Surgical
Faculty have the full benefits of his council and professional services.
That he should prefer to give up a high and honorable position in the
councils of the nation, to serve the sick, is conclusive evidence of his
devotion to their interests and of love for his profession.</p>

<h1>INVALIDS' HOTEL</h1>

<h2>A MODEL SANITARIUM AND SURGICAL INSTITUTE.</h2>

<h2>NOT A HOSPITAL, BUT A PLEASANT REMEDIAL HOME,</h2>

<h3>ORGANIZED WITH</h3>

<h2>A FULL STAFF OF EIGHTEEN PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS</h2>

<h3>AND EXCLUSIVELY DEVOTED TO THE</h3>

<h2>TREATMENT OF ALL CHRONIC DISEASES.</h2>


<p>This imposing Establishment was designed and erected to accommodate the
large number of invalids who visit Buffalo from every State and Territory,
as well as from many foreign lands, that they may avail themselves of the
professional services of the Staff of Skilled Specialists in Medicine and
Surgery that compose the Faculty of this widely-celebrated institution.</p>


<h3>DESTROYED BY FIRE</h3>


<p>On the sixteenth of February 1881, the original Invalids' Hotel was
totally destroyed by fire. Although occupied at the time by a large number
of invalids, yet, through the extraordinary exertions of the Faculty and
employees, all were safely removed from the building without injury to any
one. The Board of Trustees took prompt steps to rebuild, for the
accommodation of the many sufferers who apply, to avail themselves of the
skill, facilities and advantages of treatment which such a perfectly
equipped establishment affords. Profiting by the experience afforded by
several years' occupancy of the original Invalids' Hotel building, which at
the date of its erection was the largest and most complete establishment of
its kind in the world, we believe we have, in the building of the elegant
structure illustrated herein, made great improvements over the original
Invalids' Hotel, for the accommodation of our patients. Although our new
building has only been occupied about two years, yet almost immediately our
business required the erection of a very large addition thereto, to
accommodate our growing practice. This large <i>Annex</i>, which is about
the size of the original <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_924"
id="Page_924"></a>[pg 924]</span>building, has ever since been kept well
filled with patients, hailing from every State and Territory of the United
States, Canada and occasionally from a foreign country,</p>

<p>THE INVALIDS' HOTEL AND SURGICAL INSTITUTE IS PLEASANTLY SITUATED AT
No. 663 MAIN STREET,</p>

<p>in the city of Buffalo, just above and outside the business and bustle
of this Queen City of the Lakes. It is easily reached from the railroad
depots by the Exchange and Main Street car lines (see map on last page of
this book). It is a substantially built brick building, trimmed with
sandstone, well lighted and provided with a patent hydraulic elevator, so
that its upper stories are quite as desirable as any, being more <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_925" id="Page_925"></a>[pg 925]</span>quiet
than those lower down. It is well provided with fire escapes, and, in fact,
nothing has been neglected that can add to the comfort and home-like
make-up of this popular national resort for the invalid and afflicted.
Great pains and expense have been assumed in providing perfect ventilation
for every room and part of the building.</p>

Surgical Institute.</p>

<p>The surroundings of the Hotel are very pleasant, it being located in the
finest built part of the city, among the most elegant residences.</p>


<h3>STAFF OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS.</h3>


<p>Only men who are, by thorough education and experience, especially
fitted to fill their respective positions, have been chosen to serve as
physicians and surgeons in this institution. After having spent a very
large sum of money in erecting and furnishing this national resort for
invalids with every requirement and facility for the successful treatment
of all classes of chronic diseases, it is the determination of the Board of
Directors that the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons shall be superior in
culture, experience and skill.</p>

<p>We have not the space to speak, individually, of the eighteen
professional gentlemen composing the Faculty, but will say that among them
are those whose long connection with the World's Dispensary and Surgical
Institute has given them great experience and rendered them <i>experts</i>
in their specialties. Several of them had previously distinguished
themselves in both private and hospital practice, had held important chairs
as lecturers and teachers in Medical Colleges, and had filled <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_926" id="Page_926"></a>[pg
926]</span>responsible positions in military and civil hospitals; also in
some of the most noted Asylums, Dispensaries, and Sanitary Institutions in
the land.</p>

<p>With such a staff of Physicians and Surgeons, efficient and trained
nurses, and with all the most approved sanitary, medical and surgical
appliances which study, experience, invention and the most liberal
expenditure of money, can produce and bring together in one institution,
the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute affords the afflicted unusual
opportunities for relief.</p>


<h3>THE GRAND ENTRANCE.</h3>


<p>The entrance to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute is covered by
a lofty porch of beautiful design, the roof of which is supported upon
heavy iron columns. Above the massive double doors, through which the
visitor enters, are large, heavy panels of beautifully wrought stained
glass, on which the words "Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute" stand
out conspicuously.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise722"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:

src="images/advise722.png" /></a><br /> Gentlemen's Reception-room,
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.</p>


<h3>FIRST FLOOR.</h3>


<p>The first floor of the building is reached through a beautifully
finished vestibule, by a short flight of broad, easy stairs, and once
inside the visitor is struck by the beauty of design as well as by the
home-like <a name="Page_927" id="Page_927"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
927]</span>appearance of the surroundings. The wood-work is mainly of hard
woods, oak and cherry predominating. In a large part of the house the
floors are of oak, with a cherry border, neatly finished in oil and
shellac, and covered with rich rugs and elegant carpets of the very best
quality.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise723"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Ladies' Parlor.&mdash;Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute."
src="images/advise723.png" /></a><br />Ladies' Parlor.&mdash;Invalids' Hotel and
Surgical Institute.</p>

<p>On the first floor is the gentlemen's reception-room, which is thronged
with patients from early in the morning until late in the afternoon. It is
entirely distinct from the large reception-room and parlors for lady
patients, and the utmost privacy is secured throughout the whole
arrangement of the Institution. On this floor are the suites of offices,
parlors, and private consultation-rooms, some fifteen in all; also a well
furnished reading-room and circulating library, for the use of the inmates
of the Institution. On all sides are beautifully frescoed walls adorned
with numerous choice engravings and other pictures. All the rooms
throughout the house are furnished in the best of style, and in a manner to
afford the utmost comfort and cheerfulness of surroundings <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_928" id="Page_928"></a>[pg 928]</span>for the
sick and afflicted who seek this remedial resort. The Turkish and other
baths are elegantly fitted up on the first floor, opposite the
reading-room.</p>


<h3>THE UPPER FLOORS.</h3>


<p>Above the first, or main floor, the building is divided into separate
rooms and suites of rooms for the accommodation of patients. All are well
lighted, have high ceilings, and are cheerful and well ventilated
apartments. On the second floor is the large medical library and medical
council-room, for the exclusive use of the Faculty, also the museum-room,
which contains a large and valuable collection of anatomical and morbid
specimens, many of them being obtained from cases treated in this
Institution. On this floor are also suites of rooms, occupied by the Bureau
of Medical Correspondence, wherein from ten to twelve physicians, each
supplied with the improved graphophone, are constantly employed in
attending to the vast correspondence received from invalids residing in all
parts of the United States and Canada. Every important case receives the
careful consideration of a council composed of from three to five of these
expert specialists, before being finally passed upon and prescribed
for.</p>

<a name="Page_929" id="Page_929"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
929]</span><h3>ON THE THIRD FLOOR</h3>


<p>are the large treatment-rooms, supplied with all the apparatus and
appliances for the successful management of every chronic malady incident
to humanity. Electrical apparatus of the latest and most approved kinds,
some of it driven and operated by steam-power, dry cupping and
equalizing-treatment apparatus, "vitalization" apparatus, numerous and most
ingenious rubbing and manipulating apparatus and machinery, driven by
steam-power, are among the almost innumerable curative agencies that are
here brought into use as aids in the cure of human ailments. Our</p>

Institute.</p>

<p>is the finest to be found in any sanitarium in the United States and, we
believe, in the world. There are two forty-cell galvanic batteries with
switch boards for controlling the voltage, or force, from the whole power
to one-fortieth of this amount, at the will of the physician. Safe-guards
in the shape of milli-ampere meters continually indicate to the operator
the force of the current. There is a dynamo for charging the storage
batteries, which may be used in a patient's room when this method is found
more convenient or more comfortable for the invalid. There are <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_930" id="Page_930"></a>[pg 930]</span>two
static or Franklin machines. These are used when the milder current is
desired, and for spraying, sparking, etc. One of the instruments is of high
voltage and furnishes us with the X rays for examining the interior parts
of the body. The largest treatment room also contains a powerful ozone
generator, operated by a dynamo. This supplies the room with allotropic
oxygen and is invaluable in treating diseases of the lungs and air
passages. This supplies the patient with vitalized air, equal to the most
salubrious atmosphere in any part of the globe.</p>

<p>Beyond this and separated by a court, across which is an iron bridge,
are the large dispensing-rooms, stocked with drugs and medical compounds of
almost endless variety, and representing every branch of the <i>materia
medica</i>. Here all medicines prescribed are most carefully and specially
prepared for each individual case. Those to be sent away by mail or
express, to patients being treated at a distance, are placed in trays, with
full directions for use, and sent to another large room, where they are
carefully packed, and shipped thence to their destination.</p>


<h3>FOURTH FLOOR.</h3>


<p>On the fourth floor are located the surgical operating-rooms and
surgical ward. There are also a large number of nice, large, well furnished
separate rooms on this floor, used principally for the accommodation of
surgical cases. Strong, broad, iron staircases connect all the upper floors
with the ground, so that in case of fire, patients need have no fear of
being unable to get out safely. In fact, the building has been constructed
so as to render the rapid spread of fire through it impossible, all the
floors being laid on cement.</p>


<h3>A STEAM PASSENGER ELEVATOR</h3>


<p>is provided, so that the upper floors are quite as desirable as those
lower down. The dining-rooms for gentlemen, as well as those for ladies,
are located in the basement, which is reached either by stairways or by the
elevator. The kitchen, store-rooms, chill-rooms, pantries, and all culinary
arrangements are also in the basement.</p>


<h3>FIRE-PROOF VAULTS.</h3>


<p>Six large fire-proof vaults are provided in this building in which to
preserve, secure from observation, as well as from fire, all records of
cases examined and treated by the Faculty.</p>

<p>Throughout all this vast building the visitor is struck with the
wonderful order and system with which every detail is carried out.</p>


<h3>THE BATH DEPARTMENT.</h3>




<p class="figure"><a name="advise726"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration: A
glimpse at the Turkish Bath Department." src="images/advise726.png"
/></a><br />A glimpse at the Turkish Bath Department.</p>

<p>The Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, as hereinbefore indicated,
is provided with Turkish, and other approved baths, with a <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_931" id="Page_931"></a>[pg
931]</span>treatment-room, fitted up with vacuum and movement-treatment
apparatus of the most modern and approved style. These and much more
ingeniously devised apparatus and appliances are brought into use in a
great variety of chronic affections with marvelously successful results. A
perfect system of physical training, especially adapted to the wants of the
invalid and weak, and most skillfully conducted and applied, is not the
least important among the many advantages that the chronic sufferers here
find.</p>


<h3>THE SURGICAL DEPARTMENT.</h3>


<p>In the Surgical Department, every instrument and appliance approved by
the modern operator is provided, and many and ingenious are the instruments
and devices that the Faculty of this institution have invented and
perfected to meet the wants of their numerous cases.</p>


<h3>OUR REMEDIES.</h3>


<p>In the prescribing of remedies for disease, the Staff resort to the
whole broad field of <i>materia medica</i>, allowing themselves to be
hampered by no school, <i>ism, pathy</i>, or sect. The medicines employed
are all prepared by skilled chemists and pharmacists, and the greatest care
is exercised to have them manufactured from the freshest and purest
ingredients. Our Faculty probably employ a greater number and variety of
extracts from native roots, barks and herbs in their practice than are used
in any other invalids' resort in the land. All of the vegetable extracts
employed in our practice are prepared in our own Laboratory.</p>


<h3>REGULATION OF DIET.</h3>


<p>The table is supplied with an abundance of wholesome and nutritious
food, especially adapted and prepared to suit the invalid, it being varied
to suit each particular case. The Faculty recognize the importance of
proper food as one of the greatest factors in the treatment of chronic
diseases. While properly regulating and restricting the food of the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_932" id="Page_932"></a>[pg 932]</span>invalid
when necessary, they also recognize the fact that many are benefited by a
liberal diet of the most substantial food, as steaks, eggs, oysters, milk,
and other very nutritious articles of diet, which are always provided in
abundance for those for whom they are suited.</p>

/></a><br />View of Lake and Boat-house.&mdash;Buffalo Park.</p>

<p>From previous experience somewhere, some people get the impression that
they are to be half starved at such an institution as this. If this is the
case anywhere it is not so here, as any one who has ever resided at our
sanitarium will attest.</p>


<h3>TRAINED ATTENDANTS.</h3>


<p>A sufficient number of trained and experienced nurses are employed, that
those requiring attendance may have the very best of care.</p>


<h3>GOOD ORDER.</h3>


<p>The institution is conducted in an orderly manner, that the utmost quiet
may be secured. The Faculty insist, upon the part of the invalid, while
under treatment, on the observance of habits of regularity in eating,
sleeping, bathing and exercise. Only by such observance of hygienic laws
can they succeed in their course of remedial training, and make the
treatment curative.</p>


<h3>AMUSEMENTS.</h3>


<p>While insisting upon strict observance of rules established for the good
of the patient, they do not make their requirements so rigid as to
interfere with the comfort and enjoyment of their patients, but, on the
contrary, endeavor, in every manner possible, to provide innocent and
entertaining amusements for all, recognizing the great importance of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_933" id="Page_933"></a>[pg
933]</span>pleasant occupation of the mind, as an essential part of the
treatment. Hence the introduction of music, amusing games, light reading,
and kindred agencies for pleasant entertainment, is not neglected.</p>


<h3>UNPARALLELED SUCCESS.</h3>

Consultation-rooms, Ladies' Department.</p>

<p>The founder of this institution commenced, many years ago, with little
capital, to build up a business in the treatment of chronic diseases and
devoted himself diligently to that end. His reputation for skill in his
chosen field of practice gradually extended until, to-day, his fame and
that of the World's Dispensary and Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute,
are simply world-wide. As the business increased those eminent for skill
have been induced to join the Faculty, until eighteen professional
gentlemen, each devoting his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_934"
id="Page_934"></a>[pg 934]</span>attention to a special branch of practice,
constitute the Medical and Surgical Staff.</p>

<p>One reason why we excel in the treatment of <i>chronic diseases</i> is
the fact that we are supplied with all the modern improvements in the way
of instruments, appliances and remedial agents used in the healing art, the
expense of which deters the local physician in general practice from
procuring, for the treatment of the limited number of cases that come
within the circuit of his practice. The treatment of such cases requires
special attention and special study to be successful.</p>


<h3>A COMMON SENSE VIEW.</h3>


<p>It is a well-known fact, that appeals to the judgment of every thinking
person, that a physician who devotes his whole time to the study and
investigation of a certain class of diseases, must become better qualified
to treat them than he who attempts to treat every ill to which flesh is
heir, without giving special attention to any particular class of diseases.
Men, in all ages of the world, who have <i>made their marks</i>, or who
have become famous, have devoted their lives to some special branch of
science, art or literature.</p>


<h3>LIBERALITY.</h3>


<p>We wage no war against any physician, no matter what school of medicine
he may represent; but, on the other hand, we invite the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_935" id="Page_935"></a>[pg
935]</span>co-operation of all regular physicians. We are always ready and
willing to impart to them any information or render any assistance that
will be of mutual benefit to them and their patients.</p>


<h3>OUR PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS</h3>


<p>do not travel to solicit practice, having all the business that they can
attend to at our institution, nor do we employ any agents to travel and
peddle or otherwise sell our medicines. If any one engaged in such
business, represents himself as in any way connected with our institutions,
he is a swindler and should be apprehended and prosecuted as such. And any
one who will give us such information as will lead to the arrest and
conviction of any person so misrepresenting will be liberally rewarded.</p>

<p>While not permitting any member of our professional staff to travel and
solicit practice, yet we are always willing to accommodate and send a
specialist to visit important or critical cases in consultation, or
otherwise, or to perform important surgical operations as explained on <a
href='#Page_971'>page 971</a> of this book.</p>

<p>Let none deceive you by representing that they have heretofore <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_936" id="Page_936"></a>[pg 936]</span>been
connected with our institution and have thereby learned our original and
improved methods of treatment. We have a large and competent Staff of
Specialists and while we have sometimes found it necessary to make changes,
yet we always manage to retain the most expert and skillful, as we cannot
afford to part with the services of those who excel.</p>

<p>By adopting similar names to those which have long designated our
world-famed institutions, some have endeavored to deceive and mislead
invalids who were seeking relief. Others have named so-called "Electric"

expecting to reap benefits from Dr. Pierce's well-known professional
standing. Neither the Doctor nor this Association have any interest in any

<h1>WORLD'S DISPENSARY.</h1>


<p>The immense building erected and occupied by the World's Dispensary
Medical Association as a Laboratory, wherein are manufactured our Dr.
Pierce's Standard Family Medicines, as well as all the various Tinctures,
Fluid Extracts and other pharmaceutical preparations used by the Staff of
Physicians and Surgeons of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute in
their practice, is not inappropriately called the <i>World's
Dispensary</i>, for within its walls is prepared a series of remedies of
such exceeding merit that they have acquired world-wide fame, and are sold
in vast quantities in nearly every civilized country.</p>

<p>The structure, located at 660 to 670 Washington Street, immediately in
the rear of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, is of brick, with
sandstone trimmings, six stories high, and 100 feet square. Its most
striking architectural features exteriorly are massiveness, combined with
grace and beauty of outline, and great strength.</p>


<h3>THE BASEMENT.</h3>


<p>The basement or first story opens on a level with the Washington Street
sidewalk, and is occupied by a plant of two large boilers, which supply the
steam to run a huge American engine, of 100 horse-power, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_938" id="Page_938"></a>[pg 938]</span>built
by the American Engine Co., Bound Brook, N.J. It drives all the machinery
of the establishment, including drug mills, pill machines, packing
machinery, a large number of printing presses, folding machines, stitching,
trimming, and many other machines, located on the different floors, and
used in the manufacture of medicines, books, pamphlets, circulars, posters,
and other printed matter. On this floor is located steam bottle-washing
machinery, and also the shipping department. Here may be seen huge piles of
medicine, boxed, marked, and ready for shipment to all parts of the
civilized world. A large steam freight elevator leads from this to the
floors above.</p>

<p>In addition to the power engine just mentioned is a 25 horse-power
upright engine for running the dynamo for electric lighting, with a
capacity of three hundred (300) lights. This engine and dynamo were also
manufactured for us by the American Engine Company of Bound Brook, N.J.
There is a small dynamo with a capacity of one hundred (100) lights used
during the day to light safes, vaults, dark closets and hallways. All the
offices and rooms of patients are supplied with electric light, as well as
illuminating gas. An automatic Worthington <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_939" id="Page_939"></a>[pg 939]</span>pump is also located in
the basement. This supplies the elevator and sprinkling system. The
sprinklers come into play only in case of fire, when they are self-acting.
This pump at its best is capable of forcing nearly two hundred gallons of
water a minute. There is no place in which pure water is more desirable
than in the manufacture of medicines. Our New York filter could, if such a
large quantity were ever required, furnish the Dispensary with one hundred
(100) barrels of pure water a day. Just beyond the south wall and buried
several feet under ground is a boiler-shaped tank capable of storing ten
thousand (10,000) gallons of medicine.</p>


<h3>MAIN FLOOR.</h3>


<p>The main or second floor of the Dispensary is entered from Main Street,
through a hall leading from the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute. On
this floor are located business offices, counting-room, the advertising
department and mailing rooms. Large, fire-proof vaults are provided for the
safe keeping of books, papers, and valuables, whilst the counting-room and
offices are elegantly finished in hard woods, and present a beautiful and
grand appearance.</p>


<h3>THIRD FLOOR.</h3>


<p>On this floor are the Association's extensive printing and binding
works. Fourteen large presses, driven by power, with numerous folding
machines, trimming, cutting, and stitching machinery, are constantly
running in this department. Here is printed and bound Dr. Pierce's popular
work of over a thousand pages, denominated "The People's Common Sense
Medical Adviser," over 1,200,000 copies of which have been sold. Millions
of pocket memorandum books, pamphlets, circulars and cards are also issued
from this department and scattered broadcast to every quarter of the
globe.</p>


<h3>FOURTH FLOOR.</h3>


<p>Large mills for crushing, grinding and pulverizing roots, barks, herbs,
and other drugs occupy a considerable part of this floor. Extensive
drying-rooms, in which articles to be ground in the drug mills are properly
dried, are also located upon this floor, as are also thousands of reams of
paper ready for printing the different books, pamphlets, labels, etc. In
large rooms set aside for that purpose, are stored vast quantities of
labels and wrappers, for use in putting up medicines.</p>


<h3>FIFTH FLOOR.</h3>


<p>On this floor is located ingeniously devised filling and bottling
machinery, also rooms for labeling, wrapping, and packing medicines; others
are occupied for the storage of crude drugs, glass, corks, and supplies for
use in the general business.</p>


<h3>SIXTH FLOOR.</h3>


<p>This entire floor is occupied with mixing, percolating, distilling,
<a name="Page_940" id="Page_940"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
940]</span>filtering, and other processes employed in the manufacturing of
medicines. Every process is conducted under the watchful care of an
experienced chemist and pharmacist, and in the most perfect and orderly
manner; the apparatus employed being of the most approved character. Here
are manufactured all the various medicinal preparations and compounds
prescribed by the Faculty, in the treatment of special cases.</p>


<h3>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.</h3>

<p>In all departments of this vast business establishment, the visitor is
struck with the perfect system which everywhere prevails, and the wonderful
accuracy with which every process and transaction is carried on and
consummated; hence the uniformity of purity and strength for which the
medicines here manufactured have so long been celebrated. To this, also, is
due much of the marvelous success attained in the department established
for the special treatment of chronic and obstinate cases of disease. In
this department the Faculty are not at all limited or hampered in
prescribing, and do not confine themselves in the least to the proprietary
or standard medicines manufactured for general sale through druggists, but
employ a series of curative agents unsurpassed in variety and range of
application. They aim to carefully adapt their prescriptions to each
individual case.</p>

<h3><i>SOME OF THE CAUSES THAT LED TO ITS ERECTION, AND THE ADVANTAGES
WHICH IT AFFORDS.</i></h3>




<p class="figure"><a name="advise735"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
One of the Private Consultation-rooms, Gentlemen's Department."
src="images/advise735.png" /></a><br />One of the Private
Consultation-rooms, Gentlemen's Department.</p>

<p>The destinies of institutions, like those of men, are often determined
by pre-existing causes. The destinies of some men are like those of
way-side plants, springing up without other apparent cause than the caprice
of nature, developing without any apparent aim, yielding no perfected
fruit, and finally, dying, leaving scarcely a trace of their existence.
Thus it is with institutions which have their origin only in man's caprice.
To be enduring, they must be founded upon the needs and necessities of
humanity. Many of the great men of the world owe their greatness more to
surrounding circumstances than to the genius <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_942" id="Page_942"></a>[pg 942]</span>within them. The highest
genius can be dwarfed or deformed by the force of adverse circumstances;
hence the poetic truth of Gray in those exquisite lines:</p>

<blockquote>
"Some mute inglorious Milton here may lie,<br />
Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood."<br />
</blockquote>

<p>Opportunity is the guiding star of genius. Without it, genius would
drift hither and thither upon the restless, ever-changing waves of
circumstance, never casting anchor in a secure haven. Upon opportunity,
too, depends the success of institutions. By opportunity we mean a real and
acknowledged public want. Whoever undertakes to supply this want finds
himself upon the crest-wave of prosperity. It was to supply such a want
that this institution was erected.</p>


<h3>A REMEDIAL HOME.</h3>


<p>Of the seventy millions of people living in the United States to-day, it
is estimated that nearly twelve millions are sufferers from chronic
disease. Think for a moment! Twelve millions of people slowly but surely
dying by the insidious and fatal development of chronic diseases! This is
an appalling fact. And yet this is the very class of diseases with which
the general practitioner is least familiar.</p>

<p>As a general practitioner of the healing art, fresh from
<i>curriculum</i>, the founder of this institution early realized that the
grand unpardonable sin of the medical profession was the neglect to more
thoroughly study and investigate this class of diseases.</p>

<p>The profession is diligently cauterizing and poulticing the sores which
now and then appear on the surface, but the internal chronic disease, of
which these are merely the external signs, is too often overlooked or
neglected.</p>

<p>Some years ago we devised and put into practical operation a method
of</p>


<h3>TREATING PATIENTS AT THEIR HOMES,</h3>


<p>without requiring them to undergo personal examinations. We reasoned
that the physician has abundant opportunity to accurately determine the
nature of most chronic diseases without ever seeing the patient. In
substantiating that proposition, we cited the perfect <i>accuracy</i> with
which scientists are enabled to deduce the most minute particulars in their
several departments, which appears almost miraculous, if we view the
subject in the light of the early ages. Take, for example, the
electro-magnetic telegraph, the greatest invention of the age. Is it not a
marvelous degree of accuracy which enables an operator to <i>exactly</i>
locate a fracture in a sub-marine cable nearly three thousand miles long?
Our venerable "clerk of the weather" has become so thoroughly familiar with
the most wayward elements of nature that he can accurately predict their
movements. He can sit in Washington and foretell what the weather will be
in Florida or New York, as well as if hundreds of miles did not intervene
between him <a name="Page_943" id="Page_943"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
943]</span>and the places named. And so in all departments of modern
science, what is required is the knowledge of certain <i>signs</i>. From
these, scientists deduce accurate conclusions regardless of distance. A few
fossils sent to the expert geologist enables him to accurately determine
the rock-formation from which they were taken. He can describe it to you as
perfectly as if a cleft of it were lying on his table. So also the chemist
can determine the constitution of the sun as accurately as if that luminary
were not ninety-five million miles from his laboratory. The sun sends
certain <i>signs</i> over the "infinitude of space," which the chemist
classifies by passing them through the spectroscope. Only the presence of
certain substances could produce these solar signs.</p>

Medical Library and Council-room." src="images/advise736.png" /></a><br
/>Medical Library and Council-room.&mdash;Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute.</p>

<p>So, also, in medical science,</p>


<h3>DISEASE HAS CERTAIN UNMISTAKABLE SIGNS,</h3>


<p>or symptoms, and, by reason of this fact, we have been enabled to
originate and perfect a system of determining with the greatest accuracy
the nature of chronic diseases without seeing and personally examining our
patients. In recognizing diseases without a personal examination of the
patient, we claim to possess no miraculous powers. We obtain our knowledge
of the patient's disease by the practical application of well-established
principles of modern science to the practice of medicine. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_944" id="Page_944"></a>[pg 944]</span>And it
is to the accuracy with which this system has endowed us that we owe our
almost world-wide reputation for the skillful treatment of all lingering,
or chronic, affections. This system of practice, with the marvelous success
which has been attained through it, demonstrates the fact that diseases
display certain phenomena, which, being subjected to scientific analysis,
furnish abundant and unmistakable data to guide the judgment of the
skillful practitioner aright in determining the nature of diseased
conditions.</p>

<p>So successful has been this method of treating patients at a distance
that there is scarcely a city or a village in the United States that is not
represented by one or more cases upon the "Records of Practice" at the
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute. In all chronic diseases that are
curable by medical treatment, it is only in very rare cases that we cannot
do as well for the patient while he or she remains at home, as if here in
person to be examined. But we annually treat hundreds of cases requiring
surgical operations and careful after-treatment, and in these cases our
Invalids' Hotel, or home, is indispensable. Here the patient has the
services not only of the most skillful surgeons, but also, what is quite as
necessary in the after treatment, of thoroughly trained and skilled
nurses.</p>

<p>What should be the essential characteristics of an Invalids' Home?</p>


<h3>CLIMATE.</h3>


<p>Obviously, the most important of these characteristics is
<i>climate</i>. Climatology, from being a mere speculative theory, has
arisen to the deserved rank of a science. The influence of the climate of a
country on the national character has long been observed and acknowledged.
The languid but passionate temperaments of the South are like its
volcanoes, now quiet and silent, anon bursting forth with terrible
activity, flooding entire cities with molten fire; or, like its skies, now
sunny, cloudless, an hour hence convulsed with lightnings and deluging the
earth with passionate rain; or like its winds, to-day soft, balmy, with
healing on their wings, to-night the wind fiend, the destroying simoom,
rushing through the land, withering and scorching every flower and blade of
herbage on its way. On the other hand, the calm, phlegmatic temperament of
the North accords well with her silent mountains, her serener skies, and
her less vehement, but chilling winds. The South, too, is the native home
of the most violent acute diseases, such as yellow fever and cholera. But,
aside from this general climatic influence, there is the yet more
restricted one of locality. It has often been observed that certain classes
of diseases are most prevalent in certain localities, the prevalence in
every instance being due to peculiarities of climate.</p>


<h3>EXTREME HEALTHFULNESS OF BUFFALO.</h3>


<p>In the published records of the examination for military service in the
army, during our late civil war, this fact was clearly and definitely <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_945" id="Page_945"></a>[pg 945]</span>stated,
and maps were prepared and presented showing the comparative prevalence of
certain diseases in the several States and districts represented. The maps
are prepared by a graduation of color, the lighter shades indicating the
localities where the special disease under consideration is least
prevalent; and it is a very significant and important fact that in all
chronic diseases not due to occupation or accident, Buffalo and its
immediate vicinity is marked by the lighter shades. Thus, in epilepsy,
paralysis, scrofula, rheumatism, and consumption, our city is little more
than tinted with the several colors used to denote these diseases.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise737"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration: A
Patient's Room." src="images/advise737.png" /></a><br />A Patient's
Room.&mdash;Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.</p>

<p>There is a popular, but unfounded, belief that Buffalo is a hot-bed for
pulmonary diseases. This idea could have originated only in an ignorant
disregard of facts; for medical statistics prove that in her freedom from
this class of diseases she is unrivaled by any city in America, not
excepting those on the seaboard.</p>


<h3>EVIDENCE OF HEALTH STATISTICS.</h3>


<p>Compare, if you please, the statistics of Buffalo with those of the
great Eastern cities in this respect. In Boston and New York the death-rate
from consumption shows a ratio of about 1 to 5 of the whole number of
deaths. In Baltimore and Philadelphia the ratio is 1 to 6, while in Buffalo
the death rate from consumption is only 1 to 10&mdash;very <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_946" id="Page_946"></a>[pg
946]</span>remarkable difference in favor of our city. Only last summer a
gentleman residing in the eastern part of our State collected and compared
the health statistics for 1876 of all the prominent cities in the United
States. The result showed that</p>


<h3>BUFFALO OUTRANKS ALL IN HEALTHFULNESS.</h3>


<p>A great deal of precious breath has been expended in blustering about
"Buffalo zephyrs," as our delightful lake breezes are sometimes ironically
termed. It seems to be a popular belief among our sister cities that old
Boreas has chosen Buffalo for his headquarters. When we hear a person
dilating upon "Buffalo's terrific winds," we are reminded of one of our
lady acquaintances who recently returned from a European tour. She was
asked how she enjoyed her sea voyage, and she replied, "Oh, it was
delightful, really charming! There is something so grand about the sea!" We
were not a little surprised at this enthusiastic outburst, as we had been
told by a member of her party that the lady had industriously vomited her
way to Hamburg and back again. But the lady's enthusiasm was easily
explained. It is fashionable to characterize sea voyages as delightful,
charming, etc. Now, we suspect this popular notion about our "trying winds"
is traceable to the same source. It has become customary to call Buffalo a
"windy place," and so, when the traveler feels a slight lake breeze, he
imagines it to be a terrific gale. Whatever may have originated this
notion, certain it is that it is utterly, undeniably false; and, in making
this denial, we are not alone dependent upon observation, but upon the</p>


<h3>FACTS OF SCIENCE.</h3>


<p>The issue of July 18, 1874, of the Buffalo <i>Commercial Advertiser</i>,
contained a series of tables, furnished by the Signal Service Bureau,
showing the velocity of the wind at eleven prominent cities for the year
1873. An examination of the table shows that the total velocity for the
year was the <i>lowest in Buffalo</i> of any of the lake ports; while
Philadelphia and New York showed far higher aggregates of velocity than our
city. On this subject, in the issue of August 21st of the same year, the
editor pleasantly remarks: "Only the interior and southern seaboard cities,
and not many of them, show a lower total velocity of wind than is marked
against this city; and as for those places, heaven help their unfortunate
inhabitants in the sultry nights of the summer season, when they are
gasping in vain for a breath of that pure, cool lake air, which brings
refreshing slumbers to the people of blessed, breezy Buffalo."</p>


<h3>EQUABILITY OF CLIMATE.</h3>




<p class="figure"><a name="advise738"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
One of our Physician's Rooms" src="images/advise738.png" /></a><br /> One
of our Physician's Rooms&mdash;Bureau of Correspondence&mdash;Invalids' Hotel and
Surgical Institute.</p>

<p>Then, in regard to <i>equability of climate</i>, the great desideratum
for invalids in any locality, here again sentiment and science are greatly
at variance. An examination of the official records of the Signal Service
Bureau, and the statistics of the Smithsonian Institute, showed that out of
a list of forty cities on the continent Buffalo ranked highest <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_947" id="Page_947"></a>[pg 947]</span>for
equability of climate. Thus we quote from an editorial in the
<i>Advertiser</i> of the same issue: "While the aggregate of change for
Buffalo stood at 67 for the year, that of Philadelphia reached 204,
Washington was 224, Cincinnati 205, St. Louis 171. Winchester, in one of
the healthiest parts of Virginia, reached as high as 201. Aiken, in South
Carolina, a famous resort for invalids, touched 220. St. Augustine, one of
the lowest in the list, showed a much less equable climate than that of
Buffalo, being 94 to our 67." The transition from summer to winter, and
<i>vice versa</i>, is exceedingly gradual, and, consequently, Buffalonians
are seldom afflicted with those epidemic diseases which generally appear in
other localities during the spring and summer months. Thus the thermometric
readings of the Signal Service Bureau for 1873, show that the average
temperature for July and August was 74&deg;. For September it was about
64&deg;, which was again reduced by about 10&deg; for October. The monthly
average for November was 73&deg;, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_948"
id="Page_948"></a>[pg 948]</span>and for December 25&deg;, which was also
the average for January. Then the readings for February showed an average
of 26&deg;, for March 32&deg;, and 43&deg; for April. A more equable and
gradual transition from midsummer heat to midwinter cold cannot be shown by
any locality on this continent. Seldom does the mercury rise above ninety
during our warmest summers, or fall below zero in our most severe winters.
In J. Disturnal's work, entitled "The Influence of Climate in North and
South America," published by Van Nostrand, in 1867, the climate of Buffalo
is thus characterized: "From certain natural causes, no doubt produced by
the waters of Lake Erie, the winters are less severe, the summers less hot,
the temperature night and day more equable, and the transition from heat to
cold less rapid, in Buffalo than in any other locality within the temperate
zone of the United States, as will be seen by the following table." The
table referred to shows that, "during the summer months, the temperature of
Buffalo is from 10&deg; to 20&deg; cooler than that of any other point
east, south, or west of the ports on Lake Erie; while the refreshing and
invigorating lake breeze is felt night and day." The author further adds
that "during the winter months the thermometer rarely indicates zero, and
the mean temperature for January, 1858, was 20&deg; above."</p>

<p>A careful investigation into the comparative climatology of the several
great social and commercial centers, proved <i>Buffalo to be superior to
all others in the climatic requirements for the invalid</i>. Besides, it
has the important advantage of being a central point of traffic and travel
between the West and the East.</p>


<h3>ADVANTAGES OF LOCATION.</h3>


<p>The second important consideration in projecting this home for invalids
was <i>location</i>. It has generally been customary to locate institutions
of this character in rural districts, removed from the advantages of city
life, on the plea of escaping the confusion and excitement so detrimental
to recovery. The result is well known. Invalids have regarded them more as
pleasure resorts than health resorts, spending the summer months there, but
fleeing to their homes at the fall of the first snow-flake. The good that
was done in the summer is undone by carelessness and exposure in the
winter. A location that would combine both city advantages and rural
pleasures, seemed to us, upon reflection, to be the desirable one.
Fortunately, Buffalo afforded the happy mean. Our extensive parks, our
unsurpassed facilities for yachting, fishing, and all aquatic sports, our
many sylvan lake and river retreats, our world-famed Niagara,&mdash;certainly a
more desirable selection of rural scenes and pleasures cannot be found in
another locality in America.</p>


<h3>A GENUINE HOME.</h3>


<p>In erecting the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, our paramount
design was to make it a genuine home&mdash;<i>not a hospital</i>&mdash;a home where
<a name="Page_949" id="Page_949"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
949]</span>the child of fortune would miss none of the comforts of her
palatial home, while the poor man would find not only health but his
pleasures multiplied a thousand fold.</p>


<h3>OUR TERMS MODERATE.</h3>


<p>The wholesale merchant's prices are far less than those of the retail
dealer. He can afford it, his sales are so much larger. It is on precisely
the same principle that we are able to make the rates at the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute comparatively low. If we had only a limited
number of patients, we should be obliged to make the charges commensurate
with our expenses; but our practice having become very extensive, and the
income being correspondingly large, we are enabled to make the rates at the
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute so moderate that all who desire can
avail themselves of its medical, surgical, and hygienic advantages.</p>

/>Prescription Department&mdash;Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.</p>


<h3>FACILITIES FOR TREATMENT.</h3>


<p>Of the many advantages afforded by the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute, in treating disease, we can make only brief mention of a few of
the more prominent.</p>


<h3>DIVISION OF LABOR.</h3>


<p>In the examination and treatment of patients, our practice is divided
into specialties. Each member of the Faculty, although educated to practice
in <i>all</i> departments of medicine and surgery, is here assigned <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_950" id="Page_950"></a>[pg 950]</span>to a
special department only, to which he devotes his entire time, study and
attention.</p>


<h3>ADVANTAGES OF SPECIALTIES.</h3>


<p>The division-of-labor system proves as effectual in the exercise of the
professions as in manufactures. In the legal profession this has long been
a recognized fact. One lawyer devotes his attention specially to criminal
law, and distinguishes himself in that department. Another develops a
special faculty for unraveling knotty questions in matters of real estate,
and, if a title is to be proved, or a deed annulled, he is the preferred
counselor. In a certain manner, too, this has long been practiced by the
medical profession. Thus some physicians (and we may add physicians who
call themselves "regular," and are specially caustic in their denunciation
of "advertising doctors") are accustomed to distribute cards among their
patrons, certifying that they give special attention to diseases of women
and children. In this institution each physician and surgeon is assigned a
special department of medicine or surgery. By constant study and attention
to his department, each has become a skillful specialist, readily detecting
every phase and complication of the diseases referred to him. Not only is
superior skill thus attained, but also <i>rapidity</i> and <i>accuracy</i>
in diagnosis.</p>

<p>Thoroughness and efficiency in any branch of learning can be secured
only by devoting to it special study and attention. When the faculty of a
university is to be chosen, how are its members selected? For instance, how
is the chair of astronomy filled? Do they choose the man who is celebrated
for his general scholastic attainments, or do they not rather confer it
upon one who is known to have devoted special attention and study to the
science of astronomy, and is, therefore, especially qualified to explain
its theories and principles? Thus all the several chairs are filled by
gentlemen whose general scholarship not only is known to be of the highest
standard, but who devote special attention to the departments assigned
them, thus becoming proficient specialists therein. The same system of
specialties is observed in the departments of a medical college. The
professor who would assume to lecture in all the departments with equal
ease and proficiency would be severely ridiculed by his colleagues; and yet
it is just as absurd to suppose that the general practitioner can keep
himself informed of the many new methods of treatment that are being
constantly devised and adopted in the several departments of medicine and
surgery.</p>


<h3>PROGRESS IN MEDICINE.</h3>


<p>In no other science is more rapid and real progress being made at the
present time than in that of medicine. Even the specialist must be studious
and earnest in his work to keep himself well and accurately informed of the
progress made in his department. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_951"
id="Page_951"></a>[pg 951]</span>Thus it so often happens that the general
practitioner pursues old methods of treatment which science has long since
replaced with others, acknowledged to be superior. The specialist, on the
contrary, by confining his studies and researches to one class of diseases
only, is enabled to inform himself thoroughly and accurately on all the
improvements made in the methods and means of practice in his special
department.</p>

<p>The difference between the practice of specialists and that of general
practitioners is aptly illustrated by the difference between the
old-fashioned district school, in which the school-master taught all the
branches, from a-b-abs to the solution of unknown quantities and the
charmed mysteries of philosophy, and the modern seminary, with its
efficient corps of teachers, each devoting his or her whole attention to
the study and teaching of one special department of learning.</p>

<p>We attribute the success which has attended the practice at the
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, in a great measure, to a wise
adoption of this system of specialties.</p>


<h3>ADVANTAGES OFFERED TO INVALIDS.</h3>


<p>Obviously, the most important of these advantages is <i>facility of
treatment</i>. Of the thousands whom we have cured of chronic diseases, we
have probably not seen one in five hundred, having accomplished the desired
result through remedies sent either by mail or express, and advice given by
letter. Yet in some obstinate forms of disease, we can here bring to bear
remedial means not to be found or applied elsewhere.</p>

<p>That thousands of cases of chronic disease, pronounced incurable, have,
by our rational and scientific treatment, been restored to perfect health,
is conclusively proved by the records of practice at the Invalids' Hotel
and Surgical Institute. Here, in obstinate cases, are brought to bear all
the most scientific remedial appliances and methods of treatment.</p>

<p>A system of mechanical movements, passive exercises, manipulations,
kneadings and rubbings, administered by a large variety of
ingeniously-contrived machinery, driven by stream-power, has been found
especially efficacious and valuable, as an aid to medical and surgical
treatment, in the cure of obstinate cases of nervous and sick headache,
constipation, paralysis, or palsy, stiffened joints, crooked and withered
limbs, spinal curvature, tumors, diseases of women, especially
displacements of the uterus, or womb, such as prolapsus, retroversion and
anteversion, chronic inflammation, enlargement and ulceration of the
uterus, and kindred affections; also in nervous debility, sleeplessness,
and other chronic diseases. Mechanical power, or force, is by these
machines transmitted to the system, in which it is transformed into vital
energy and physical power or strength. This mechanical, passive exercise,

confounded with, "Swedish movements," <span class="pagenum"><a

superior in efficacy. Coupled with our improved and wonderful system of
"Vitalization" treatment, it affords the most perfect system of physical
training and development ever devised. For the restoration of power to
wasted, undeveloped, or weakened organs or parts, for their enlargement,
this combined movement and "Vitalization" treatment is unequaled. It can be
applied to strengthen or enlarge any organ or part. We also employ both
Dynamic and Static electricity, "Franklinism" and Electrolysis, and
chemical, Turkish and other baths, in all cases in which they are
indicated. Inhalations, administered by means of the most approved
apparatus, are employed with advantage in many obstinate lung, bronchial,
and throat affections. We have no <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_953"

good remedial means being overlooked or neglected.</p>

<h3>A FAIR AND BUSINESS-LIKE OFFER TO THE AFFLICTED.</h3>


<p>Reader, are you accustomed to think and act for yourself? Do you consult
your own reason and best interests? If so, then do not heed the counsel of
skeptical and prejudiced friends, or jealous physicians, but listen to what
we have to say.</p>

<p>You perhaps know nothing of us, or our systems of treatment, or of the
business methods we employ. You may <i>imagine</i>, but you <i>know
nothing</i>, perhaps, of our facilities and advantages for performing cures
in cases beyond the reach or aid of the general practitioner. Knowing
nothing, then, of all these advantages, you still know as much as the
would-be friend or physician who never loses an opportunity to traduce and
misrepresent us, and prejudice the afflicted against us.</p>

<p>Now to the point&mdash;are you listening? Then permit us to state that we
have the largest, the best, and the finest buildings of any like
Association, company, or firm in this country. We employ <i>more</i> and
<i>better</i> Medical and Surgical Specialists in our Invalids' Hotel and
Surgical Institute than any similar Association, company, or individual,
and actually have more capital invested. We have a thoroughly qualified and
eminent Specialist for every disease that we treat. We treat more cases,
<i>and absolutely cure more patients</i> than any similar institution in
America. In addition to those we treat medically, we perform all the most
difficult surgical operations known to the most eminent Surgeons, and so
frequently do many of these operations occur with us that some of our
Specialists have become the most expert and skillful Surgeons on this
continent.</p>

<p>We wish to add further that we are responsible to <i>you</i> for what we
represent; we therefore ask you to come and visit our institutions; and, if
you find on investigation that we have misstated or misrepresented <i>in
any particular</i> our institutions, our advantages, or our success in
curing Chronic Diseases, <i>we will gladly and promptly refund to you all
the expenses of your trip</i>. We court honest, sincere investigation, and
are glad and anxious to show interested people what we can do and are daily
doing for suffering humanity. Can a proposition be plainer? Can an offer be
more fair and business-like? If, therefore, you are afflicted, and are
seeking relief, come where genuine ability is a ruling feature, where
<i>success</i> is our watchword and the alleviation of human suffering our
mission.</p>

<p>Whether arriving in our city by day or night, <i>come directly to the
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, 663 Main Street</i>, where you will
be hospitably received and well cared for.</p>

<h2>SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT</h2> <h3>OF</h3> <h1>CHRONIC OR LINGERING
DISEASES.</h1>




<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise741"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
" src="images/advise741.png" /></a><br /></p>

<p>For many years the founder of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute
and World's Dispensary has devoted himself very closely to the
investigation and treatment of chronic diseases. Some few specifics have,
during this time, been developed for certain forms of chronic ailments, and
given to the public, but they have not been lauded as "cure-alls," or
panaceas, but only recommended as remedies for certain well-defined and
easily recognized forms of disease. These medicines are sold through
druggists very largely, and have earned great celebrity for their many
cures. So far from claiming that these proprietary medicines will cure all
diseases, their manufacturers advise the afflicted that, in many
complicated and delicate chronic affections, they are not sufficient to
meet the wants of the case. These must have special consideration and
treatment by a competent physician and surgeon, the medicines and other
remedial means required being selected and prepared with reference to each
particular case.</p>

<p>In order to be able to offer those afflicted with chronic ailments the
most skillful medical and surgical services, Dr. Pierce, many years ago,
associated with himself several eminent physicians and surgeons, as the
Faculty of the old and renowned World's Dispensary, the consulting
Department of which is now merged with the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute.</p>


<h3>DIVISION OF LABOR.</h3>


<p>In the organization of the medical and surgical staff of the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute, several years ago, we assigned to one
physician the examination and treatment of diseases of the nervous system;
to another, surgical operations and the treatment of surgical diseases; a
third had charge of catarrhal and pulmonary diseases and affections of the
heart; a fourth attended to diseases peculiar to women; a fifth, to
diseases of the eye and ear; a sixth, to diseases of the digestive organs;
a seventh, to special surgical cases; to another we entrusted diseases of
the urogenital organs; and to others, various <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_955" id="Page_955"></a>[pg 955]</span>other specialties. Now
that our practice has become so very extensive as to require for its
conduct a greatly increased number of physicians and surgeons. Thus four
physicians and surgeons devote their undivided attention to the examination
and treatment of diseases of the urinary and generative organs of men.
Three physicians give their sole attention to diseases peculiar to women
and three to those of the nasal organs, throat and chest, embracing all
chronic diseases of the respiratory organs. Thus we have a full council of
three and four physicians in these several specialties. In several other
divisions we have two specialists. No case is slighted either in the
examination or in the treatment. All doubtful, obscure or difficult cases
are submitted to a council composed of several physicians and surgeons.
Skilled pharmaceutists are employed to compound the medicines prescribed.
For the purpose of enabling us to conduct our extensive correspondence (for
we have an extensive practice en every part of the United States and
Canada, as well as in Great Britain from our London branch), graphophones
are employed, to which replies are dictated, recording the words of the
speaker. Afterwards the letters are written <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_956" id="Page_956"></a>[pg 956]</span> out in full, generally on
a type-writing machine, which prints them in a plain, legible style. These
machines are operated as rapidly as a person can think of the letters which
compose a word, each operator thus accomplishing the work of several
copyists. This system, by which we are enabled to correspond with our
patients as rapidly as we can talk, has been rendered necessary by the
growth of our business, which has attained immense proportions, giving rise
to so large a correspondence that a dozen physicians cannot possibly
conduct it all and give each patient's case careful attention, without the
employment of graphophones and all other facilities which modern invention
has given us. By the adoption of these various means, we are enabled to
fully meet the demands of the afflicted, and give every case the most
careful attention.</p>

Faculty" src="images/advise742.png" /></a><br />Faculty of Invalids' Hotel
and Surgical Institute in Session.&mdash;Council-room.</p>

<p>As many persons, particularly young ladies and gentlemen, having catarrh
or almost any other chronic disease, especially if of the urogenital
organs, are very sensitive and fearful that somebody will know that they
are afflicted and employing medical treatment, precautions are taken that
none who consult us may incur the least risk of exposure. Although none but
the most honorable and trustworthy gentlemen are employed as assistants,
yet as a <i>guarantee</i> of perfect security to our patients, that every
communication, whether made in person or by letter, will be treated as
<i>sacredly confidential</i>, each professional associate, clerk, or
assistant, is required to take a solemn oath of secrecy. Great care is also
taken to send all letters and medicines carefully sealed in plain envelopes
and packages, so that no one can even <i>suspect</i> the contents or by
whom they are sent.</p>


<h3>ADVANTAGES OF SPECIALTIES.</h3>


<p>By thorough organization and a perfect system of subdividing the
practice of medicine and surgery in this institution, every invalid
consulting us is treated by a specialist&mdash;one who devotes his undivided
attention to the particular class of diseases to which his or her case
belongs. The advantage of this arrangement must be obvious. Medical science
offers a vast field for investigation, and no physician can, within the
limit of a single life-time, achieve the highest degree of success in the
treatment of <i>every</i> malady incident to humanity. A distinguished
professor in the medical department of one of our universities, in an
address to the graduating class, recently said: "Some professional men seem
to be ashamed unless they have the character of universal knowledge. He who
falls into the error of studying everything will be certain to know nothing
well. Every man must have a good foundation. He must, in the first place,
be a good general practitioner. But the field has become too large to be
cultivated in its entirety by any individual; hence the advantage of
cultivating special studies in large towns, which admit of the subdivision
of professional pursuits. It is no longer possible to know everything;
<a name="Page_957" id="Page_957"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
957]</span>something must be wisely left unknown. Indeed, a physician, if
he would know anything well must be content to be profoundly ignorant of
many things. He must select something for special study, and pursue it with
devotion and diligence. This course will lead to success, while the attempt
to do everything eventuates unavoidably in failure. Let there be single
hands for special duties." Our institution is the only one in this country
in which these common-sense-ideas are <i>thoroughly</i> carried out. The
diversified tastes and talents of physicians cause each to excel in
treating some one class of diseases, to which he devotes more attention and
study than to others. One medical student manifests great interest in the
anatomy, physiology, pathology, and treatment of diseases of the eye. He
becomes thoroughly familiar with all the minutest details relative to that
organ and its diseases, and so thoroughly qualifies himself in this branch
of knowledge that he is able to cure an inflammation or other affection of
the eye in a very short time. Another student is more interested in some
other class of diseases, for the study of which he has a liking, and
neglects to inform himself in the ophthalmic branch of medical and surgical
science. If after engaging in the practice of his chosen profession, he is
consulted by persons suffering from diseases of the eye, he tortures them
with unnecessary and oftimes injurious applications, clumsily and
carelessly made, and, as the result of such unskillful treatment, the
inestimable blessing of sight may be sacrificed.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise743"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration: A
Corner in Printing Department." src="images/advise743.png" /></a><br />A
Corner in Printing Department.&mdash;World's Dispensary.</p>

<p>The great majority of physicians allow acute maladies, diseases of
children, and the practice of midwifery, to engross most of their time and
attention. They manifest an absorbing interest in everything that <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_958" id="Page_958"></a>[pg 958]</span>relates
to these subjects, and devote little or no time to acquiring an intimate
knowledge of the great variety of chronic maladies which afflict mankind.
They acquire skill and reputation in their favorite line of practice, but
are annoyed if consulted by one suffering from some obscure chronic
affection, usually turn the invalid off with a very superficial
examination, and, perhaps, only prescribe some placebo,<sup><a href="advise09.html#fn6"
name="rfn6">[6]</a></sup> apparently indifferent as to the result, but
really desiring thus to conceal their lack of familiarity with such
diseases. The specialist, the treatment of chronic diseases being his
vocation, is equally annoyed if consulted by those suffering from acute
diseases, but does not pursue the inconsistent course of assuming to treat
them. He refers them to those of his medical brethren whose daily dealings
with such cases make them, in his way of thinking, more competent than
himself to render valuable service to such sufferers. He recognizes the
fact that no man is likely to succeed in any line of study or business for
which he possesses no talent or relish, nor does he believe in being a
"jack-at-all-trades and master of none."</p>


<h3>ADVERTISING.</h3>


<p>Having thoroughly qualified himself for the practice of some particular
branch of the healing art, the specialist sees no impropriety in
acquainting the public with his ability to relieve certain forms of
suffering. He believes that medical men should possess equal rights with
other business men, and that any code of medical ethics which would deprive
him of any of the sacred rights guaranteed to all by the liberal laws of
the country, is professional <i>tyranny</i>, and merits only his
contemptuous disregard. Nor does he display any false modesty in the
<i>manner</i> of making known his skill. He maintains that he has an
undoubted right to place his claim to patronage before the public by every
fair and honorable means. He recognizes the display of goods in the
merchant's show-windows as no less an advertisement and in no better taste
than the publication of a card in the newspaper. So, likewise, he regards
the various devices by which the extremely <i>ethical</i> physician seeks
to place himself conspicuously before the public, as but so many ways of
advertising, and as not more modest than the publication of cures actually
performed, or than his announcement through the public press of his
professional resources for treating certain maladies.</p>


<p>The physician who expresses a "holy horror" of the "<i>advertising
doctor</i>," liberally bestowing upon him the epithet of "quack," announces
<i>himself</i> a graduate, talks learnedly and gives notice to the public
in <i>some</i> way that he is ready to serve them. He endeavors to impress
upon the mind of the patient and family his skill, frequently exaggerates
as to the extent of his practice, rides furiously about when he has no
professional calls, keeps up business appearances by driving <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_959" id="Page_959"></a>[pg 959]</span>several
horses, or joins influential societies. He may make a great display in
style, manner, dress, pretensions, writing for the newspapers, exhibiting
literary pedantry, referring to the superior facilities afforded by some
particular school or society to which he belongs; or by editing and
publishing a medical journal, ostensibly for the advancement of medical
science, but practically to display titles or professorships, to publish
reports which flatteringly allude to cases he has treated, the number of
capital surgical operations he has performed, or the distinguished families
he is treating. All these are but <i>modes of advertising</i> professional
wares; in short, are artful, though not refined, tricks, resorted to for
private announcement. We say to all such adventurers in modern advertising
diplomacy, that these indirect, clandestine methods are not half so candid
and honorable as a direct public statement of the intentions and proposals
of a medical practitioner, who thereby incurs an individual responsibility
before the law and his fellow-men.</p>

<p>No good reason has ever been assigned why any well educated physician,
trained in the school of experience until he becomes proficient in medical
skill, may not publish facts and evidence to disclose it, especially when
these are abundant and conclusive. The following extracts from an able
article by the Rev. THOMAS K. BEECHER embodies a sound view of the subject
of medical advertising. He says:</p>

<p>* * "I am glad that the doctor cured him; I am glad that the doctor put
it in the paper that he could cure him. And if any doctor is certain that
he can cure such diseases and don't put it in the paper, I am sorry. What a
pity it would have been had this doctor come to town with his wealth of
science and experience and gone away leaving him uncured! What a pity it
would have been if he had been so prejudiced against advertising as to read
the responsible certificate of the doctor and give him the go-by as a
quack! What are newspapers for, if not to circulate information? What more
valuable information can a newspaper give than to tell a sick man where he
can be cured? If a man has devoted his life and labor to the study of a
special class of diseases, the necessity of his saying so becomes all the
more pressing. His <i>duty</i> to advertise becomes imperative.</p>

<p>"When I was in England, I found on all the dead walls of London,
placards, declaring that Dean Stanley, Chaplain to the Prince of Wales,
would preach at such a place; that his grace the Archbishop (I think) of
Canterbury would preach at another time and place; again, that an Oxford
professor would preach. In short, religious notices were sprinkled in among
the theater bills, and the highest church dignitaries were advertised side
by side with actors, singers, and clowns. Of course, I was shocked by it,
but in a moment I bethought me&mdash;if it be all right and dignified to hire a
sexton to ring a bell when the minister is going to preach, it is all the
same to silence the bell and hire a bill-sticker to tell the same news, the
essential thing being to tell the truth every time. The remedy for the
lying advertisements is for honest men to tell the truth. 'When iniquity
cometh in like a flood, then the spirit of the Lord lifts up the standard.'
A really able man, whatever be his gifts, makes a great mistake if he fail
to use those gifts through want of advertising."</p>

<p><a name="Page_960" id="Page_960"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
960]</span>If a physician possesses knowledge that enables him to remedy
diseases heretofore regarded as incurable, what virtue or modesty is there
to "hide his light under a bushel"? In this free country the people think
and act for themselves, and hence all have a deep concern in the subject of
health. The strong popular prejudice against the doctors who advertise is
due to the fact, that by this method so many ignorant charlatans are
enabled to palm off their worthless services upon the uneducated and
credulous; but the practice of such imposition should not cause a
presumption against the public announcement of real skill, for the baser
metal bears conclusive evidence that the pure also exists.</p>

<p>Every step in scientific investigation, every proposition which relates
to the interest and happiness of man, every statement and appeal involving
a valuable consideration, must be submitted to the scrutiny and judgment of
individual reason; for every person has the right to form his own
conclusions, and justify them by experience. Those claims which are only
supported by empty assertion are very doubtful. Misty theories vanish
before the sun of truth. He who renders professional services cannot be
successful, unless he be sustained by real merit.</p>


<h3>TREATING PATIENTS WHO RESIDE AT A DISTANCE.</h3>


<p>We can treat many chronic diseases as successfully without as with a
personal consultation, as our vast experience enables us to correctly
determine the malady from which the patient is suffering, from a history of
the symptoms, and answers to questions furnished. We have not seen one
person in five hundred of those whom we have cured.</p>

<p>Some may suppose that a physician cannot obtain, through correspondence,
a sufficiently accurate idea of the condition of a patient to enable him to
treat the case successfully; but a large experience in this practice has
proved the contrary to be true, for some of the most remarkable cures have
been effected through the medium of correspondence. In most long-continued
cases, the patient has thought over his symptoms hundreds of times. The
location of every pain, whether acute or mild, constant or occasional, and
the circumstances under which it occurs, have been carefully noted. He has
observed whether he had a rush of blood to the head, was feverish or
chilly, whether troubled with cold hands and feet, whether full of blood,
or pale and bloodless; and he states these matters with accuracy and common
sense when writing to us, for he has a very good, if not a professional,
knowledge of the relative importance of these symptoms. So in regard to
digestion, he states what kinds of food agree with him, or whether he is
troubled with excessive acidity or a flatulent condition of the stomach. He
also informs us whether his tongue is coated and bilious, or clean and
healthy, and gives many other particulars too various to enumerate, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_961" id="Page_961"></a>[pg 961]</span>by
which we are enabled to gain a perfect understanding of the case. If his
description be not sufficiently complete to enable us to obtain a definite
understanding of the case, he is requested to answer a list of important
questions which are sent him. The people are far more intelligent in these
matters than physicians are generally willing to admit. A patient is often
confused while being personally examined by a physician, and gives
imperfect or incorrect answers. After he has left the presence of the
physician, he finds that he has failed to enumerate many of the most
important symptoms. In consulting by letter, the patient is not
embarrassed, he states the exact symptoms, and carefully reads over the
letter to see if it is a complete and accurate description of his
sufferings. In this way he conveys a much better idea of the case than if
present in person, and subjected to the most thorough questioning and
cross-examination. The timid lady and nervous young man write just as they
feel; and one important reason why we have had such superior success in
treating intricate and delicate diseases, is because we have obtained such
true and natural statements of the cases from these letters, many of which
are perfect pen-pictures of disease. As bank-tellers and cashiers, who
daily handle large quantities of currency, can infallibly detect spurious
money by a glance at the engraving or a touch of the paper, so the
experienced physician, by his great familiarity with disease, becomes
equally skilled in detecting the nature and extent of a chronic malady from
a written description of its symptoms.</p>


<h3>URINARY SIGNS.</h3>


<p>A careful microscopical examination and chemical analysis of the urine
is a valuable aid in determining the nature of many chronic diseases,
particularly those of the nervous system, blood, liver, kidneys, bladder,
prostate gland and generative organs. This important fact is not overlooked
at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, where an experienced chemist
is employed to make such examinations and report the result to the
attending physicians. Medical authors, professors, and practitioners of all
schools, admit and even insist upon the importance of such examinations in
diagnosticating diseases. Many practitioners neglect to take advantage of
this invaluable aid, while others fear that if they attach much importance
to such examinations they will be ranked with "uroscopian" or "water"
doctors, a class of enthusiasts who claim to be able to correctly
diagnosticate every disease by an examination of the urine. Persons
consulting us and wishing to avail themselves of the advantages afforded by
these examinations can send small vials of their urine by express. The
vials should be carefully packed in saw-dust or paper and enclosed in a
light wooden box. All charges for transportation must be prepaid, and a
complete history of the case including the age and sex of the patient, must
accompany each package, or it will receive no attention. This saves
valuable time by directing the examination into the channels indicated,
thus avoiding a lengthy series <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_962"
id="Page_962"></a>[pg 962]</span>of experiments. As we are daily receiving
numerous vials of urine, every sample should, to prevent confusion, be
labeled with the patient's name.</p>

<p>There is a natural, definite proportion of the component elements of
every solid and fluid of the human body. These proportions have been
reduced to definite standards, a deviation from which affords evidence of
disease. Thus, there being a fixed standard in a normal proportion of the
elements of the blood, any deviation from it, as in an&aelig;mia,
leucocyth&aelig;mia, etc., indicates disease. So also the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_963" id="Page_963"></a>[pg
963]</span>standard proportion of the urinary elements being known, any
considerable change, either in quantity or quality of its parts, bears
unmistakable evidence of disease. The invention of the microscope has
provided increased facilities for detecting diseases by examination of the
urine. By the aid of this wonderful instrument, we are enabled to discover
with absolute certainty the various urinary deposits characteristic of
different maladies; thus in Fig. 1, A represents in a general way the
sediment of abnormal urine as seen under the microscope. In division B is
represented oxalate of urea upon precipitation by oxalic acid. Nitrate of
urea is represented in division C. A deficiency of urea in the urine, with
albumen and casts present, is a most important guide in the diagnosis of
Bright's disease. The average quantity of urea present during health is
21.57 parts in 1,000. The microscopic examination of the urine,
notwithstanding the distaste, and even contempt, which many physicians
manifest for such investigations, is pursued at the Invalids' Hotel and
Surgical Institute, with inestimable benefit to our patients. It has
revealed the existence of many serious affections, which, with all our
other modes of investigation, we might have been unable to detect. It has
also thrown light upon many obscure chronic diseases.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise746"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:

<p>We have already spoken of the marked changes effected in the urine by a
derangement of the digestive functions. It is a matter of surprise that
physicians generally pay so little attention to the urine when dyspepsia is
suspected, since all admit that an examination of that excretion furnishes
unmistakable evidence of the nature and complications of the disease. In
this way we are many times enabled to determine whether the indigestion is
caused by <a name="Page_964" id="Page_964"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
964]</span>congestion or functional disease of the liver or kidneys or by
nervous debility. And when such cases are treated in accordance with the
indications furnished, increased success attends our practice. In Fig. 2
highly magnified urinary deposits, which indicate impairment of the
digestive functions, are represented. The crystals are composed of oxalate
of lime and appear in the different forms shown in the five sections, of
octahedral, decahedral, round and dumb bell shapes. The latter are formed
in the kidneys, and are sometimes discovered adhering to casts.</p>

<p>The various forms of gravel, Bright's disease of the kidneys,
h&aelig;maturia, inflammation of the kidneys and bladder, diabetes, and other
functional and organic diseases of the urinary organs effect characteristic
changes in the urine, thus enabling us to distinguish them with certainty
and exactness. Some of the various microscopical appearances of the urinary
deposits in diseases of the kidneys and bladder, are represented in Fig. 3.
In division A is represented pus and mucus, with decomposition, indicating
suppuration somewhere along the urinary tract. In B pus globules are alone
represented. In the division marked C are shown blood corpuscles as they
are arranged in blood drawn from a vein or artery. D represents the same
separated, as they always are when present in the urine. In E highly
magnified oil globules are represented. If present in the urine, they
indicate disease of the kidneys. In F are represented epithelial cells, the
presence of which in large numbers is indicative of diseases of the mucous
lining of the urinary organs.</p>

<p><a name="Page_965" id="Page_965"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
965]</span>Fig. 4 represents the microscopic appearance of phosphates in
the urine. These are present in great quantity in cases of nervous debility
and kindred affections. By attaching the <i>camera lucida</i> to the
microscope we can throw an image of these urinary deposits upon paper. By
the art of the engraver this may be faithfully traced, and thus we are
enabled to produce an accurate representation of them. Some of the
beautiful crystalline deposits shown in Fig. 4 represent less than a
millionth part of a grain, yet their forms are delineated with geometrical
precision. Earthy phosphates are often mistaken for pus and also seminal
fluid. Phosphates are always found in decomposed urine, otherwise they
indicate brain affections, acute cystitis, etc. Experience has taught us
that the voiding of urine loaded with phosphates is a forerunner of
cystitis, or enlargement of the prostate gland, or both. In fact, persons
so affected are "prone to serious consequences from mild attacks of almost
any and every acute disease."</p>

<p>Fig. 5 represents the microscopic appearance of mixed urinary deposits.
In division A is represented fermentation spores as they appear in diabetic
urine. Pasteur asserts that the germs of this fungus get into the urine
after it has been passed. Urates appear in division B. These indicate waste
of flesh, as in fevers, consumption, prolonged physical efforts, etc.
Division C pictures urates of ammonia. These appear in alkaline
decomposition of the urine; it is isomeric with uric acid in acid urine. In
division D is represented urate of soda, which is present in the tissues of
persons suffering from gout. The crystals shown in division E consist of
the same salt.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise750"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 6." src="images/advise750.png" /></a><br />Fig. 6.</p>

<p>In Fig. 6, division A, is represented purulent matter as it appears in
the urine. The formation of pus in different parts of the genitourinary
<a name="Page_966" id="Page_966"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
966]</span>system is accompanied by the appearance of pus corpuscles in the
urine. When fat globules, represented in division B, are found in the
urine, they indicate fatty degeneration. In division C are representations
of the cells found in the urine of persons suffering from cystitis or other
inflammatory diseases.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise751"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 7." src="images/advise751.png" /></a><br />Fig. 7.</p>

<p>Fig. 7, divisions A and B, represent different forms of cystine.
Fortunately this substance is rarely found in the urine. When present
however it indicates liability to, or the actual presence of, a calculus or
stone in the bladder. In division C is a representation of the deposits
seen in the urine of those who are greatly debilitated. In division D are
seen epithelial cells mixed with mucus.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise752"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 8." src="images/advise752.png" /></a><br />Fig. 8.</p>

<p>In Fig. 8, division A, are represented the caudated cells from the deep
structure of the bladder. The cells represented in division B are amyloid
concretions, found where there is an enlarged prostate gland.</p>

<p>Fig. 9 represents the appearance of spermatozoa as seen in the urine.
When present, they afford indisputable evidence of the escape of semen in
the renal excretions.</p>

<p>We might add many other illustrations of urinary deposits and state
their several indications, but a sufficient number has been introduced to
show the importance and practical value of microscopic examinations of the
urine in revealing obscure diseases.</p>

<p>Although the microscope is of inestimable value in examining the renal
excretion, it does not entirely supersede other valuable instruments and
chemical re-agents in determining constitutional changes. By the urinometer
we determine the specific gravity of the urine; by the use of litmus its
acid or alkaline reaction, is ascertained; while various chemicals, when
added to it, produce certain specific changes, according to the morbid
alterations which it has <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_967"
id="Page_967"></a>[pg 967]</span>undergone by reason of disease. By the
application of heat, or the addition of a few drops of nitric acid, the
albumen, which is invariably present in Bright's disease of the kidneys, is
coagulated. By the employment of other re-agents we may determine the
presence of sugar&mdash;a characteristic of diabetic urine. And thus we might
mention almost innumerable chemical tests by which the several changed
conditions of the urine, <i>characteristic</i> of different diseases, may
be ascertained with <i>absolute certainty</i>.</p>


<h3>THE MOST EMINENT MEDICAL AUTHORITIES ENDORSE IT.</h3>

<p>Dr. Eberle, a distinguished allopathic author, thus writes: "Whatever
may be the disease, the urine seldom fails in furnishing us with a clue to
the principles upon which it is to be treated."</p>

<p>Dr. Braithwaite also says: "We can arrive at a more accurate knowledge
respecting the nature of diseases from examining the urine than from any
other symptom."</p>

<p>Golding Bird, whose writings are regarded as sound and practical by the
most learned of the medical profession, says: "The examination of the urine
in disease is now regarded as one of the most important aids in diagnosis,
and which it would be injurious alike to the welfare of the patient and the
credit of the practitioner to avoid."</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise753"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 9." src="images/advise753.png" /></a><br />Fig. 9.</p>

<p>The eminent Dr. F. Simon writes as follows: "From the physical and
chemical state of the urine, the attentive and observing physician may
obtain a great quantity of information for ascertaining and establishing a
diagnosis. More than all other signs, the correct examination of the
sediment is of importance to the physician. * * * For the medical man it is
the compass which guides him in the unlimited chaos of disease and its
treatment; for the patient it is the thermometer of his condition, the
premonitory indication of the decrease or aggravation of his malady; and
for the healthy man it is the regulator of his diet and his life. Every one
is aware of the variations of the barometer, and we know that the
fluctuations of the column of mercury are closely associated with the
variable conditions of the atmosphere; so, to the practical observer,
variations of the urine, as well as the elements composing it, point out
with certainty the changes in health, and the condition of the organs."</p>

<p>While we recognize the importance of examining the urine as an aid in
distinguishing diseases, and have made this old German method of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_968" id="Page_968"></a>[pg
968]</span>diagnosis a special study, yet we do not claim that <i>all</i>
diseases can be unmistakably distinguished by such examinations
<i>alone</i>. We take a conservative position and have no confidence in
that class of ignorant fanatics whose pet hobby is "uroscopy."</p>

<p>From every person who solicits our professional services, we require
explicit answers to numerous important questions, that we may know the age,
sex, vocation, etc., as well as the prominent symptoms manifested.</p>


<h3>CONSULTATIONS BY LETTER.</h3>


<p>Formerly, we published in this book a very extensive list of questions
to be answered by those consulting us, but a large experience has convinced
us that beyond requiring answers to a few leading questions, which we still
retain, it is better to let the patient describe the malady in his or her
own way and language. After receiving and considering such a history, if we
do not fully understand the patient's malady, we will ask such further
questions as may be necessary. The patient should, however, in addition to
writing name, post-office, county, and state, <i>plainly</i>, state the
name of the town containing the nearest express office. Next give age, sex,
whether married or single, complexion, height, present and former weight,
if known, and occupation. State also if you have been a hard worker, and
whether it is necessary for you to labor hard now, how long you have been
out of health, and from what particular symptoms you suffer most. Follow
this with a history of your case in your own language. If you find in this
volume an accurate description of your disease, state the page and
paragraph where it occurs.</p>


<h3>FREE CONSULTATION.</h3>


<p>We now make no charge for consultation by letter, but, instead of the
one dollar formerly charged by us as a consultation fee, as we are desirous
of making our facilities for treatment known to invalids far and near, we
request that all persons writing to us for advice send us the names of all
those within the circle of their acquaintance who are in any way in need of
medical or surgical treatment for chronic diseases. If convenient, send the
list on a separate piece of paper.</p>


<h3>CHARGES MUST BE PREPAID.</h3>


<p>Should you send a vial of urine for analysis, about a cupful will do,
and <i>all express charges on it must be prepaid</i>. All liquids are
excluded from the mails, when discovered, and yet we have received hundreds
of samples through the mails safely when put in homoeopathic or other
<i>very small</i> vials, well corked and carefully packed in a light tin
can or <i>wooden</i> box, or in a light pine stick bored out hollow, the
vial being carefully packed in sufficient saw-dust or blotting paper to
absorb all liquid should the vial get broken. Letter postage, that is, two
cents for each one ounce or fraction thereof, must be paid upon these
sealed packages. Send the first urine that is passed after rising in the
morning.</p>


<a name="Page_969" id="Page_969"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
969]</span><h3>RELIABLE MEDICINES.</h3>


<p>Next in importance to a correct understanding of the patient's disease,
is the possession of reliable remedies for its treatment. Many of the
medicines employed by physicians engaged in general practice are prepared
from old drugs that have lost all their medicinal virtues, and hence are
utterly useless and ineffectual. Many vegetable extracts are inert, because
the plants from which they are produced were not gathered at the proper
time. To give the reader an idea of the great care which we exercise in the
selection and preparation of our medicines, he is requested to read under
the head of "The Preparation of Medicines," in "The People's Common Sense
Medical Adviser."</p>


<h3>OUR TERMS FOR TREATMENT</h3>


<p>require the payment of monthly fees, in advance, which entitles the
patient to medicines specially prepared for and adapted to his or her
particular case, and to all necessary attention and advice. Our fees for
treatment are moderate, varying according to the nature and requirements of
each particular case, and will be made known at the time of
consultation.</p>


<h3>WHY OUR FEES ARE REQUIRED IN ADVANCE.</h3>


<p>We receive applications from strangers residing in all parts of America,
and even in foreign countries, and it is not reasonable to suppose that
credit could be dispensed so indiscriminately. It would not be a correct
business transaction for a merchant to send a barrel of sugar or a roll of
cloth to a stranger living hundreds of miles away, to be paid for when
used. Our knowledge and medicines constitute our capital in business, and
an order upon that capital should be accompanied with an equivalent. Some
applicants refer us to their neighbors for a testimonial of their
integrity. We cannot spare the time or employ assistants to make such
inquiries for the sake of trusting any one. Should credit be thus
indiscriminately given, there would necessarily be losses, and, to
compensate for these, and the extra expense incurred by the employment of
assistants, our fees would have to be much larger, thereby imposing the
burden upon those who <i>do</i> pay. Instead of following this method of
procedure, we place professional services within the reach of all, so that
a greater number may be benefited. Many invalids say that they have paid
large sums of money to medical men for treatment without obtaining relief.
Unfortunately our land is cursed with quacks and unprincipled
practitioners, who seek no one's good but their own, and it is a defect in
our law that it permits such swindlers to go unpunished. Not so
reprehensible is the family physician who fails, because his limited and
varied practice does not permit him to become proficient in treating
chronic diseases.</p>

<p><a name="Page_970" id="Page_970"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
970]</span>The following beautiful sentiment of Hood truthfully expresses
the sacredness of the physician's trust:</p>

<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Above all price of
wealth<br />
The body's jewel. Not for minds or hands profane<br />
To tamper with in practice vain.<br />
Like to a woman's virtue is man's health;<br />
A heavenly gift within a holy shrine!<br />
To be approached and touched with serious fear,<br />
By hands made pure and hearts of faith severe,<br />
E'en as the priesthood of the One Divine."<br />
</blockquote>

<p>We are in regular practice, responsible for what we say and do, and
cordially invite those who desire further evidence of our success in curing
chronic diseases to come to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute and
satisfy themselves of the truthfulness of our statements.</p>

<p>We are warranted in saying that our responsibility and disposition for
fair dealing are known to many of the principal mercantile houses, as well
as to all prominent American editors. We also refer to our present and
former patients, one or more of whom may be found in almost every hamlet of
America. To all who are under our treatment we devote our highest energies
and skill, fully realizing that an untold blessing is conferred upon every
person whom we cure, and that such cures insure the permanency of our
business. On the contrary, we realize how unfortunate it is for us to fail
in restoring to health any person whom we have encouraged to hope for
relief. We are careful, therefore, not to assume the treatment of incurable
cases, except when desired to do so for the purpose of mitigating suffering
or prolonging life; for we never wish to encourage false hopes of
recovery.</p>


<h3>TERMS FOR BOARD AND TREATMENT AT THE INVALIDS' HOTEL AND SURGICAL
INSTITUTE</h3>

<p>are moderate, varying with the nature of the case and the apartments
occupied. At times so great is the number applying to avail themselves of
the skill of our Faculty, and the advantages which our institution affords,
that we are unable to receive all applicants. To be sure of securing good
apartments, it is well to engage them sometime ahead, and make an advance
payment of fifty dollars or more upon them, which will be refunded in case
acute sickness or any similar cause should prevent the patient from
occupying them at the time specified. Complete terms for treatment and
board can be arranged only when personal application for entrance to the
institution is made, and the nature and extent of the disease and the
necessary treatment fully determined by personal examination of the case.
If satisfactory terms and arrangements cannot at that time be agreed upon,
or if the case be deemed incurable, any advance payments that have been
made to secure good apartments will be promptly refunded.</p>


<a name="Page_971" id="Page_971"></a><span class="pagenum">[pg
971]</span><h3>SPECIAL ADVICE.</h3>


<p>Those coming here to consult us personally, should bring the money to
pay for our services and for board and care while remaining here, in the
form of drafts on New York City, Boston or Chicago, and <i>not</i> in the
form of checks on a local or home bank. Such drafts can be purchased in the
home bank by paying a small amount for the exchange. If more convenient,
post office orders payable at Buffalo post office will do.</p>


<h3>VISITING PATIENTS WHO RESIDE AT A DISTANCE.</h3>


<p>We are frequently asked to visit patients residing hundreds of miles
away, that we may personally examine their cases, or perform difficult
surgical operations. We can seldom comply with such requests as the time of
our professional Staff is generally very fully occupied.</p>


<h3>TO PHYSICIANS</h3>

<p>wishing to consult us in intricate cases of chronic diseases under their
treatment, we desire to say that we shall, as in the past, take pleasure in
responding to their solicitations. We have all the necessary instruments
and appliances required in executing the most difficult surgical
operations, and, as we have had much experience in this department, we are
always ready and able to assist physicians who do not practice operative
surgery. In this age of railways and telegraphs medical and surgical aid
can be summoned from a distance and promptly obtained.</p>


<h3>OUR MEDICINES</h3>


<p>as put up for sale through druggists, are not recommended as
"cure-alls," or panaceas, but only as superior remedies for certain common
and easily-recognized diseases. They are our favorite prescriptions,
improved and perfected by long study and a vast experience in the treatment
of chronic diseases, and have gained world-wide celebrity and sale. We are
well aware that there are many chronic diseases that can only be
successfully treated and cured by careful adaptation of remedies to each
individual case. This is especially true of the ever-varying and delicate
diseases of the kidneys and bladder. It is not less so with reference to
nervous debility, involuntary vital losses, with which so many young and
middle-aged men are afflicted; and we may also include in this list
epilepsy or fits, paralysis or palsy, obstinate gleety discharges, and many
other chronic and delicate ailments of which our staff of physicians and
surgeons cure annually many thousands of cases, but <i>for which we do not
recommend</i> any of our put-up, ready-made, or proprietary medicines.</p>


<h3>NO RELATIONSHIP WITH HUMBUGS.</h3>


<p>Had our put-up or proprietary medicines, as sold by druggists the world
over, been adapted to all classes and forms of chronic diseases, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_972" id="Page_972"></a>[pg 972]</span>there
would have been no necessity for our organizing a competent staff of
physicians and surgeons to act as experts in the treatment of difficult,
obscure, and complicated cases of chronic diseases. That we keep constantly
employed, in our Buffalo and London institutions, eighteen medical
gentlemen, with such helpers as chemists, clerks, etc., is indisputable
proof that the medicines we offer for sale through druggists should not be
classed with the humbug nostrums recommended to cure everything. They are
the outgrowth of our vast and extended practice in the treatment of chronic
diseases; are well-tried, world-famed, and <i>honest medicines</i>. They
are not unduly puffed and lauded, but simply recommended for such diseases
as are easily recognized and which they are <i>known to cure.</i></p>


<h3>NOT CONFINED IN PRESCRIBING</h3>


<p>Our physicians, in the treatment of cases consulting us, prescribe just
such medicines as are adapted to each particular case. <i>They are not
confined in the least</i> to our list of a few put-up or proprietary
medicines (valuable as they are when applicable to the case) but resort to
the whole broad range of the <i>materia medica</i>, employed by the most
advanced physicians of the age. They are not hampered by any school,
<i>ism</i> or "<i>pathy</i>."</p>


<h3>OUR MEDICINES PREPARED WITH THE GREATEST CARE.</h3>


<p>The medicines employed are all prepared in our own Laboratory by skilled
chemists and pharmacists, and the greatest care is exercised to have them
manufactured from the freshest and purest ingredients. Our Faculty probably
employ a greater number and variety of native roots, barks, and herbs, in
their practice then are used in any other invalids' resort in the land.
Using vast quantities of these indigenous medicines, we can afford and do
not neglect to have them gathered with great care, at the proper seasons of
the year, so that their medicinal properties may be most reliable. Too
little attention is generally paid to this matter, and many failures result
from the prescribing of worthless medicines by physicians who have to
depend for their supplies upon manufacturers who are careless or
indifferent in obtaining the crude plants and roots from which to
manufacture their medicines for the market. While depending largely upon
solid and fluid extracts of native plants, roots, barks, and herbs, in
prescribing for disease, yet we do not use them to the exclusion of other
valuable curative drugs and chemicals. We aim to be unprejudiced and
independent in our selection of remedies, adopting at all times a rational
system of therapeutics. This liberal course of action has, in a vast
experience, proved most successful.</p>
