<h1>HYGIENE.</h1>




<h2><a name='IICHAPTER_I'></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h1>HYGIENE DEFINED.&mdash;PURE AIR.</h1>


<p>The object of hygiene is the <i>preservation of health</i>. Hitherto, we
have considered, at some length, the science of functions, or
<i>Physiology</i>, and now, under the head of <i>Hygiene</i>, we will give
an outline of the means of maintaining the functional integrity of the
system. It is difficult to avoid including under this head Preventive
Medicine, the special province of which is to abate, remove, or destroy the
many causes of disease.</p>

<p>The Greeks bestowed divine honors upon Aesculapius, because he remedied
the evils of mankind and healed the sick. The word hygiene is derived from
Hygeia, the name of the Greek goddess of health. As male and female are
made one in wedlock, so Medicine and Hygiene, restoration and preservation,
are inseparably united.</p>

<p>Hygiene inculcates sanitary discipline, medicine, remedial discipline;
hygiene prescribes healthful agencies, medical theory and practice,
medicinal agencies; hygiene ministers with salubrious and salutary agents,
medicine assuages with rectifying properties and qualities; hygiene upholds
and sustains, medical practice corrects and heals; the one is preservative
and conservative, the other curative and restorative. These discriminations
are as radical as health and sickness, as distinct as physiology and
pathology, and to confound them is as unnatural as to look for the beauties
of health in the chamber of sickness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[pg
223]</span>The true physician brings to his aid Physiology, Hygiene, and
Medicine, and combines the science of the former with the art of the
latter, that restoration may be made permanent, and the health preserved by
the aid of hygiene. But when any one makes Hygiene exclusively the
physician, or deals wholly in hygienic regulations with little respect for
physiology, or lavishly advertises with hygienic prefixes, we may at once
consider it a display, not of genuine scientific knowledge, but only of the
ignorance of a quack. Some of the modern twaddle about health is a
conglomeration of the poorest kind of trash, expressing and inculcating
more errors and whims than it does common sense. Many persons dilate upon
these subjects with amazing flippancy, their mission seeming to be to
traduce the profession rather than to act as help-mates and assistants. We
do not believe that there is any real argument going on between the
educated members of the medical profession but rather that the senseless
clamor we occasionally hear comes only from the stampede of some routed,
demoralized company of quacks.</p>

<p>In the following pages we shall introduce to the reader's attention
several important hygienic subjects, although there are many more that
ought to receive special notice. Such as we do mention, demand universal
attention, because a disregard of the conditions which we shall enumerate,
is fraught with great danger. Our lives are lengthened or shortened by the
observance or neglect of the rules of common sense, and these do not
require any great personal sacrifice, or the practice of absurd
precautions.</p>


<h4>PURE AIR FOR RESPIRATION.</h4>


<p>Ordinary atmospheric air contains nearly 2,100 parts of oxygen and 7,900
of nitrogen, and about three parts of carbonic acid, in 10,000 parts;
expired air contains about 470 parts of carbonic acid, and only between
1500 and 1600 parts of oxygen, while the quantity of nitrogen undergoes
little or no alteration. Thus air which has been breathed has lost about
five per cent. of oxygen and has gained nearly five per cent. of carbonic
acid. In addition the expired air contains <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[pg 224]</span>a greater or less quantity
of highly decomposable animal matter, and, however dry the atmospheric air
may be, the expired air is always saturated with watery vapor, and, no
matter what the temperature of the external air may be, that of the exhaled
air is always nearly as warm as the blood. An adult man on a average
breathes about sixteen times in a minute and at every inspiration takes in
about thirty cubic inches of air, and at every expiration exhales about the
same amount. Hence, it follows that about 16-2/3 cubic feet of air are
passed through the lungs of an adult man every hour, and deprived of oxygen
and charged with carbonic acid to the amount of nearly five per cent. The
more nearly the composition of the external air approaches that of the
expired air, the slower will be the diffusion of carbonic acid outwards and
of oxygen inwards, and the more charged with carbonic acid and deficient in
oxygen will the blood in the lungs become. Asphyxia takes place whenever
the proportion of carbonic acid in the external air reaches ten per cent.,
providing the oxygen is diminished in like proportion, and it does not
matter whether this condition of the external air is produced by shutting
out fresh air from a room or by increasing the number of persons who are
consuming the same air; or by permitting the air to be deprived of oxygen
by combustion by a fire. A deficiency of oxygen and an accumulation of
carbonic acid in the atmosphere, produce injurious effects, however, long
before the asphyxiating point is attained. Headache, drowsiness, and
uneasiness occur when less than one per cent. of the oxygen of the
atmosphere is replaced by other matters, and the constant breathing of such
an atmosphere lowers vitality and predisposes to disease.</p>

<p>Therefore, every human being should be supplied, by proper ventilation,
with a sufficient supply of fresh air. Every adult individual ought to have
at least 800 cubic feet of air-space to himself, and this space ought to
communicate freely with the external atmosphere by means of direct or
indirect channels. Hence, a sleeping-room for one adult person should not
be less than nine by ten feet in breadth and length and nine feet in
height. What occurred in the Black Hole at Calcutta is an excellent
illustration of the effect of vitiated air. One hundred and forty-six
Englishmen were confined in a room eighteen <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[pg 225]</span>feet square, with two
small windows on one side to admit air. Ten hours after their imprisonment,
only twenty-three were alive.</p>

<p><b>Ventilation of School Rooms</b>. The depression and faintness from
which many students suffer, after being confined in a poorly ventilated
school room, is clearly traceable to vitiated air, while the evil is often
ascribed to excessive mental exertion. The effect of ventilation upon the
health of students is a subject of universal interest to parents and
educators, and at present is receiving the marked attention of school
authorities. Dr. F. Windsor, of Winchester, Mass., made a few pertinent
remarks upon this subject in the annual report of the State Board of
Health, of Massachusetts, 1874. One of the institutions, which was spoken
of in the report of 1873, as a <i>model</i>, in the warming and ventilation
of which much care had been bestowed, was visited in December, 1873. He
reports as follows: "I visited several of the rooms, and found the air in
all, offensive to the smell, the odor being such as one would imagine old
boots, dirty clothes, and perspiration would make if boiled down together;
again, in the new <i>model</i> school-house the hot air enters at two
registers in the floor on one side, and makes (or is supposed to make) its
exit by a ventilator at the floor, on the other side of the room." The
master said "<i>the air was supposed to have some degree of intelligence,
and to know that the ventilator was its proper exit</i>." Thorough
ventilation has been neglected by many school officials on account of the
increased expense it causes. In our climate, during seven months at least,
pure atmospheric air must be paid for. The construction of vertical ducts,
the extra amount of fuel, and the attendant expenditures are the objections
which, in the opinion of many persons, outweigh the health and happiness of
the future generation. It is necessary for the proper ventilation of our
school rooms that an adequate supply of fresh air should be admitted, which
should be warmed before being admitted to the room, and which should be
discharged as contaminated, after its expiration. The proper ventilation of
the school room consists in the warming and introduction of fresh air from
without, and the discharge of the expired and unwholesome air from within.
This may be accomplished by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226"
id="Page_226"></a>[pg 226]</span>means of doors, windows, chimneys, and
finally by ventilators placed, one near the level of the floor, and the
other near the ceiling of the room. The ventilators ought to be arranged on
the opposite sides of the room, in order to insure a current, and an
abundant supply of air. When trustees and patrons realize that pure air is
absolutely essential to health, and that their children are being slowly
poisoned by the foul air of school rooms, then they will construct our
halls of learning with a due regard for the laws of hygiene, and students
will not droop under their tasks on account of the absence of Nature's most
bountiful gift, <i>pure air</i>.</p>

<p><b>Ventilation of Factories and Workshops</b>. This is a subject which
demands the immediate attention of manufacturers and employers. The odors
of oil, coal gas, and animal products, render the air foul and stagnant,
and often give rise to violent diseases among the operatives. From two to
four hundred persons are often confined in workshops six hundred feet long,
with no means of ventilation except windows <i>on one side only</i>. The
air is breathed and re-breathed, until the operatives complain of languor
and headache, which they attribute to overwork. The <i>real</i> cause of
the headache is the inhalation of foul air at every expansion of the lungs.
If the proprietors would provide efficient means for ventilating their
workshops, the cost of construction would be repaid with compound interest,
in the better health of their operatives and the consequent increase of
labor. Our manufacturers must learn and practice the great principle of
political economy, namely, that the interests of the laborer and employer
are mutual.</p>

<p><b>Ventilation of our dwellings</b>. Not less important is the
ventilation of our dwellings; each apartment should be provided with some
channel for the escape of the noxious vapors constantly accumulating. Most
of the tenements occupied by the poor of our cities are literally dens of
poison. Their children inhale disease with their earliest breath. What
wonder that our streets are filled with squalid, wan-visaged children!
Charity, indeed, visits these miserable homes, bringing garments and food
to their half-famished inmates; but she has been slow to learn that fresh
air is just as essential to life as food or clothing. Care should be taken
by the public <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227"
id="Page_227"></a>[pg 227]</span>authorities of every city, that its
tenement houses do not degenerate into foul hovels, like those of the poor
English laborer, so graphically portrayed by Dickens. But ill-ventilated
rooms are not found exclusively in the abodes of the poor. True, in the
homes of luxury, the effect of vitiated air is modified by food, etc. Men
of wealth give far more attention to the architecture and adornment of
their houses, to costly decorations and expensive furniture, than to proper
ventilation. Farmers, too, are careless in the construction of their
cottages. Their dwellings are often built, for convenience, in too close
proximity to the barn. Because they do not construct a suitable sewer or
drain, the filth and refuse food is thrown out of the back door, where it
accumulates and undergoes putrefaction; the vitiated air penetrates the
interior of the house, and, there being no means of ventilation, it remains
to be breathed by the occupants. The result is, that for the sake of saving
a few dollars, which ought to be expended in the construction of necessary
flues and sewers, the farmer often sees the child he prizes far more than
his broad acres gradually decline, or suddenly fall a victim to fevers or
malignant disease. Parents, make your homes healthy, let in the pure, fresh
air and bright sunlight, so that your conscience may never upbraid you with
being neglectful of the health and lives of your little ones.</p>


<h4>SITE FOR HOMES.</h4>


<p><b>Malaria</b>. When about to construct our residences, besides securing
proper ventilation and adequate drainage, we ought to select the location
for a home on dry soil. Low levels, damp surroundings, and marshy
localities not only breed malaria and fevers, but are a prolific cause of
colds, coughs, and consumption. Care should be taken not to locate a
dwelling where the natural currents of air, or high winds, will be likely
to bring the poison of decayed vegetable matter from low lands. Certain
brooks, boggy land, ponds, foggy localities, too much shade, all these are
favorable to the development of disease. Then the walls of a building
should be so constructed as to admit air between the exterior and interior
surfaces, otherwise the interior of the house will be damp and unwholesome.
In the dead of winter in northern latitudes <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>[pg 228]</span>the house ought to be kept
slightly tempered with warmth, both night and day, a condition very
favorable to the introduction and change of atmospheric currents. The
invigorating tendencies of a dry, pure atmosphere are remarkably
beneficial, while air charged with moisture and decay is exceedingly
baneful, introducing diseases under various forms.</p>

<p>Neither should the dwelling be shaded by dense foliage. The dampness of
the leaves tends to attract malaria. Trees growing a little distance from
the house, however, obstruct the transmission of unhealthy vapors arising
beyond them. Malaria generally lurks near the surface of the earth, and
seems to be more abundant in the night time. Persons sleeping in the upper
story of a house may escape its morbid influence, while those occupying
apartments on the lower floor, become affected.</p>


<h4>DAMP CELLARS.</h4>


<p>Damp cellars, under residences, are a fruitful cause of disease. Dr.
Sanford B. Hunt, in an article in the <i>Newark Daily Advertiser</i>,
speaking of the recent epidemic of diphtheria in New York City, says:</p>

<p>"Pestilences that come bodily, like cholera, are faced and beaten by
sanitary measures. Those which come more subtly need for their defeat only
a higher detective ability and a closer study of causes, many of which are
known, but hidden under the cellars of our houses, and which at last are
only preventable by public authority and at public expense in letting out
the imprisoned dampness which saturates the earth on which our dwellings
are built. Where wood rots, men decay. This is clearly shown in the
sanitary map printed in the <i>Times</i>. In the great district surrounding
Central Park, and which participates in its drainage system, there are no
cases. On the whole line of Fifth Avenue there are none. The exempt
districts are clearly defined by the character of the soil, drainage, and
sewerage, and by the topography, which either has natural or artificial
drainage, but most of which is so dry that only surface-water and
house-filth&mdash;which does not exist in those palaces&mdash;can affect the health
of the residents. But in the tenement houses and on the made lands where
running streams have been filled in and natural springs choked up by earth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[pg
229]</span>fillings, diphtheria finds a nidus in which to develop itself.
The sanitary map coincides precisely with the topographic map made by Gen.
Viele. Where he locates buried springs and water-courses, there we find the
plague spots of diphtheria and in the same places, on previous maps
prepared by the Board of Health, we find other low types and stealthy
diseases, such as typhoid and irruptive fevers, and there we shall find
them again when the summer and autumnal pestilences have yielded place to
those which belong to the indoor poisoned air in the winter. The experience
of other cities, notably London and Dublin, once plague spots and now as
healthy as any spot on earth, proves that most of the causations of disease
are within the control of the competent sanitary engineer, even in
localities crowded beyond American knowledge, and houses built upon soil
saturated for centuries with the offal of successive and uncleanly
generations. Wet earth, kept wet by the boiling up of imprisoned springs,
is a focus of disease. Dry earth is one of the most perfect deodorizers,
the best of oxydizers and absorbents, destroying the germs of disease with
wonderful certainty. On those two facts rests the theory of public
hygiene."</p>


<h4>DUST AND DISEASE.</h4>


<p>The air we breathe is heavily loaded with minute particles of floating
dust, their presence being revealed only by intense local illumination.
Professor Tyndall says: "solar light, in passing through a dark room,
reveals its track by illuminating the dust floating in the air. 'The sun,'
says Daniel Culverwell, 'discovers atoms, though they be invisible by
candle-light, and makes them dance naked in his beams.'"</p>

<p>After giving the details and results of a series of experiments in which
he attempted to extract the dust from the air of the Royal Institute by
passing it through a tube containing fragments of glass wetted with
concentrated sulphuric acid, and thence through a second tube containing
fragments of marble wetted with a strong solution of caustic potash, which
experiments were attended with perfect failure, the Professor continues, "I
tried to intercept this floating matter in various ways; and on the day
just mentioned, prior to sending the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[pg 230]</span>air through the drying
apparatus, I carefully permitted it to pass over the tip of a spirit-lamp
flame. The floating matter no longer appeared, having been burnt up by the
flame. It was, therefore, of <i>organic origin</i>. I was by no means
prepared for this result; for I had thought that the dust of our air was,
in great part, inorganic and non-combustile." In a foot note he says,
"according to an analysis kindly furnished me by Dr. Percy, the dust
collected <i>from the walls</i> of the British Museum contains fully fifty
per cent of inorganic matter. I have every confidence in the results of
this distinguished chemist; they show that the <i>floating</i> dust of our
rooms is, as it were, winnowed from the heavier matter." Again he says:
"the air of our London rooms is loaded with this organic dust, nor is the
country air free from its presence. However ordinary daylight may permit it
to disguise itself, a sufficiently powerful beam causes dust suspended in
air to appear almost as a semi-solid. Nobody could, in the first instance,
without repugnance, place the mouth at the illuminated focus of the
electric beam and inhale the thickly-massed dust revealed there. Nor is the
repugnance abolished by the reflection that, although we do not see the
floating particles, we are taking them into our lungs every hour and minute
of our lives." "The notion was expressed by Kircher and favored by
Linnaeus, that epidemic diseases are due to germs which float in the
atmosphere, enter the body, and produce disturbance by the development
within the body of parasitic life. While it was struggling against great
odds, this theory found an expounder and a defender in the President of
this institution. At a time when most of his medical brethren considered it
a wild dream, Sir Henry Holland contended that some form of the germ-theory
was probably true." Professor Tyndall proposes means by the application of
which air loaded with noxious particles may be freed from them before
entering the air passages. The following embodies his suggestions on this
point:</p>


<h4>COTTON-WOOL RESPIRATOR.</h4>


<p>"I now empty my lungs as perfectly as possible, and placing a handful of
cotton-wool against my mouth and nostrils, inhale through it. There is no
difficulty in thus filling the lungs <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[pg 231]</span>with air. On expiring this
air through a glass tube, its freedom from floating matter is at once
manifest. From the very beginning of the act of expiration the beam is
pierced by a black aperture. The first puff from the lungs abolishes the
illuminated dust, and puts a patch of darkness in its place; and the
darkness continues throughout the entire course of the expiration. When the
tube is placed below the beam and moved to and fro, the same smoke-like
appearance as that obtained with a flame is observed. <i>In short, the
cotton-wool, when used in sufficient quantity, and with due care,
completely intercepts the floating matter on its way to the lungs</i>.</p>

<p>The application of these experiments is obvious. If a physician wishes
to hold back from the lungs of his patient, or from his own, the germs or
virus by which contagious disease is propagated, he will employ a
cotton-wool respirator. If perfectly filtered, attendants may breathe the
air unharmed. In all probability the protection of the lungs and mouth will
be the protection of the entire system. For it is exceedingly probable that
the germs which lodge in the air-passages, or find their way with the
saliva into the stomach with its absorbent system, are those which sow in
the body epidemic disease. If this be so, then disease can be warded off by
carefully prepared filters of cotton-wool. I should be most willing to test
their efficacy in my own person. But apart from all doubtful applications,
it is perfectly certain that various noxious trades in England may be
rendered harmless by the use of such filters. I have had conclusive
evidence of this from people engaged in such trades. A form of respirator
devised by Mr. Garrick, a hotel proprietor in Glasgow, in which inhalation
and exhalation occur through two different valves, the one permitting the
air to enter through the cotton-wool, and the other permitting the exit of
the air direct into the atmosphere, is well adapted for this purpose. But
other forms might readily be devised."</p>


<h4>LIGHT AND HEALTH.</h4>


<p>Our dwellings ought freely to admit the sunlight. Diseases which have
baffled the skill of physicians have been known to yield when the patients
were removed from dark rooms to light and cheerful apartments. Lavoisier
placed light, as an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232"
id="Page_232"></a>[pg 232]</span>agent of health, even before pure air.
Plants which grow in the shade are slender and weak, and children brought
up in dark rooms are pale, sallow, and rickety. It is a bad practice to
avoid the sunlight through fear of spoiling the complexion, since the sun's
rays are necessary to give to it the delicate tints of beauty and health.
Air is necessary for the first inspiration and the last expiration of our
lives, but the purity and healthfulness of the atmosphere depend upon the
warming rays of the sun, while our bodies require light in order that their
functions may be properly performed. We know that without solar light,
there can be no proper vegetable growth, and it is equally necessary for
the beauty and perfection of animal development. Our dwellings should
therefore be well lighted and made as bright and cheerful as possible.
Women who curtain the windows, soften the light, and tint the room with
some mellow shade, may do so in order to hide their own faulty complexions.
The skin of persons confined in dungeons or in deep mines becomes pale or
sickly yellow, the blood grows watery, the skin blotches, and dropsy often
intervenes. On the other hand, invalids carried out from darkened chambers
into the bright sunlight are stimulated, the skin browns, nutrition becomes
more active, the blood improves, and they become convalescent. Light is
especially necessary for the healthy growth of children. There is nothing
more beautiful and exhilarating than the glorious sunlight. Let its
luminous, warming, and physiological forces come freely into our dwellings,
enter into the chemistry of life, animate the spirits, and pervade our
homes and our hearts with its joy-inspiring and health-imparting
influences.</p>

<h2><a name='IICHAPTER_II'></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h1>FOOD. BEVERAGES. ALCOHOLIC LIQUORS. CLOTHING.</h1>


<p>The human body is continually undergoing changes, which commence with
the earliest dawn of existence and end only with death. The old and
worn-out materials are constantly being removed to make room for the new.
Growth and development, as well as the elimination of worn-out and useless
matter, continually require new supplies, which are to be derived from our
food. To fulfill these demands it is necessary that the nutriment should be
of the proper quality, and of sufficient variety to furnish all the
constituents of the healthy body. In order that food may be of utility,
like other building materials, it must undergo preparation; the crude
substance must be worked up into proper condition and shape for use, in
other words, it must be <i>digested</i>. But this does not end the process
of supply, each different substance must be taken by the different bands of
workmen, after due preparation in the workshop, to its appropriate locality
in the structure, and there fitted into its proper place; this is
<i>assimilation</i>. In reality it becomes a portion of the body, and is
advantageous in maintaining the symmetry and usefulness of the part to
which it is assigned; this constitutes the ultimate object of food,
<i>nutrition</i>.</p>

<p><b>Eating</b> is the process of receiving the food into the mouth,
<i>i.e., prehension; mastication and insalivation</i>&mdash;minutely dividing
and mixing it with the saliva; <i>deglutition</i>&mdash;conveying it to the
stomach. Plenty of time should be taken at meals to thoroughly masticate
the food and mix it with the saliva, which, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[pg 234]</span>being one of the natural
solvents, favors its farther solution by the juices of the stomach; the
healthy action of the digestive powers is favored by tranquility of mind,
agreeable associations, and pleasant conversation while eating. It is
proverbial of the American people that they bolt their food whole, washing
it down with various fluids, thus forcing the stomach to perform not only
its own duties, but also those of the teeth and salivary glands. This
manner of dispatching food, which should go through the natural process
above described, is not without its baleful consequences, for the Americans
are called a nation of <i>dyspeptics</i>.</p>

<p>Eating slowly, masticating the food thoroughly, and drinking but
moderately during meals, will allow the juices of the stomach to fulfill
their proper function, and healthy digestion and nutrition will result. If
the food is swallowed nearly whole, not only will a longer time be required
for its solution, but frequently it will ferment and begin to decay before
nutritive transformation can be effected, even when the gastric juice is
undiluted with the fluids which the hurried eater imbibes during his
meal.</p>

<p><b>Regularity of Meals</b> cannot be too strongly insisted upon. The
stomach, as well as other parts of the body, must have intervals of rest or
its energies are soon exhausted, its functions impaired, and
<i>dyspepsia</i> is the result. Nothing of the character of food should
ever be taken except at regular meal times. Some persons are munching
cakes, apples, nuts, candies, etc., at all hours, and then wonder why they
have weak stomachs. They take their meals regularly, and neither eat
rapidly nor too much, and yet they are troubled with indigestion. The truth
is they keep their stomachs almost constantly at work, and hence tired out,
which is the occasion of the annoyance and distress they experience.</p>

<p><b>Eating too much.</b> It should always be remembered that the
nutrition of our bodies does not depend upon the amount eaten, but upon the
amount that is digested. Eating too much is nearly as bad as swallowing the
food whole. The stomach is unable to digest all of it, and it ferments and
gives rise to unpleasant results. The unnatural distention of the stomach
with food causes it to press upon the neighboring <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[pg 235]</span>organs, interfering with
the proper performance of their functions, and, if frequently repeated,
gives rise to serious disease. People more frequently eat too much than too
little, and to omit a meal when the stomach is slightly deranged is
frequently the best medicine. It is an excellent plan to rise from the
table before the desire for food is quite satisfied.</p>

<p><b>Late Suppers</b>. It is generally conceded that late suppers are
injurious, and should never be indulged in. Persons who dine late have
little need of food after their dinner, unless they are kept up until a
late hour. In such cases a moderate meal may be allowed, but it should be
eaten two or three hours before retiring. Those who dine in the middle of
the day should have supper, but sufficiently early so that a proper length
of time may elapse before going to bed, in order that active digestion may
not be required during sleep. On the other hand, it is not advisable to go
wholly without this meal, but the food eaten should be light, easily
digestible, and moderate in quantity. Persons who indulge in hearty suppers
at late hours, usually experience a poor night's rest, and wake the next
morning unrefreshed, with a headache and a deranged stomach. Occasionally
more serious consequences follow; gastric disorders result, apoplexy is
induced; or, perhaps, the individual never wakes.</p>

<p><b>Feeding Infants</b>. For at least six or seven months after birth,
the most appropriate food for an infant is its mother's milk, which, when
the parent is healthy, is rich in all the elements necessary for its growth
and support. Next to the mother's milk, that of a healthy nurse should be
preferred; in the absence of both, milk from a cow that has recently calved
is the most natural substitute, in the proportion of one part water to two
parts milk, slightly sweetened. The milk used should be from but one cow.
All sorts of paps, gruels, panadas, cordials, laxatives, etc., should be
strictly prohibited, for their employment as food cannot be too severely
censured. Vomiting, diarrhea, colic, green stools, griping, etc., are the
inevitable results of their continued use. The child should be fed at
regular intervals, of about two hours, and be limited to a proper amount
each time, which, during the first month, is about two ounces. From 11 P.M.
to 5 A.M. the child <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236"
id="Page_236"></a>[pg 236]</span>should be nursed but once. As the child
grows older the intervals should be lengthened, and the amount taken at a
time gradually increased. The plan of gorging the infant's stomach with
food every time it cries, cannot be too emphatically condemned.</p>

<p>After the sixth or seventh month, in addition to milk, bits of bread may
be allowed, the quantity being slowly increased, thus permitting the diet
to change gradually from fluid to solid food, so that, when the teeth are
sufficiently developed for mastication, the child has become accustomed to
various kinds of nourishment. Over-feeding, and continually dosing the
child with cordial, soothing syrups, etc., are the most fruitful sources of
infant mortality, and should receive the condemnation of every mother in
the land.</p>

<p><b>Preparation Of Food</b>. The production of pure blood requires that
all the food selected should be rich in nutritious elements, and well
cooked. To announce a standard by which all persons shall be guided in the
selection and preparation of their food is impossible. Especially is this
the case in a country the inhabitants of which represent almost every
nation on the face of the globe. Travelers are aware that there is as much
diversity in the articles of food and methods of cookery, among the various
nationalities, as in the erection of their dwellings, and in their mental
characteristics. In America we have a conglomeration of all these peoples;
and for a native American to lay down rules of cookery for his German,
French, English, Welsh, and Irish neighbors, or <i>vice versa</i>, is
useless, for they will seldom read them, and, therefore, cannot profit by
them. There are, however, certain conditions recognized by the hygienic
writers of every nation. The adequate nutrition of the organic tissues
demands a plentiful supply of pure blood, or the digestive apparatus will
become impaired, the mental processes deranged, and the entire bony and
muscular systems will lose their strength and elasticity, and be
incapacitated for labor.</p>

<p><b>Different Kinds of Food Required</b>. The different periods and
circumstances of life require their appropriate food, and the welfare of
mankind demands that it should supply both the inorganic and organic
substances employed in the development of every tissue. The inorganic
elements employed in our <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237"
id="Page_237"></a>[pg 237]</span>construction, of which <i>Phosphorus,
Sulphur, Soda, Iron, Lime,</i> and <i>Potash</i> are the most important,
are not considered as aliments, but are found in the organic kingdom,
variously arranged and combined with organic materials in sufficient
quantities for ordinary purposes. When, however, from any cause, a lack of
any of these occurs, so that their relative normal proportions are
deranged, the system suffers, and restoration to a healthy condition can
only be accomplished by supplying the deficiency; this may be done by
selecting the article of food richest in the element which is wanting, or
by introducing it as a medicine. It must be remembered that those
substances which enter into the construction of the human fabric, are not
promiscuously employed by nature, but that each and every one is destined
to fulfill a definite indication.</p>

<p><i>Lime</i> enters largely into the formation of bone, either as a
<i>phosphate</i> or a <i>carbonate</i>, and is required in much greater
quantities in early life, while the bone is undergoing development, than
afterwards. In childhood the bones are composed largely of animal matter,
being pliable and easily moulded. For this reason the limbs of young
children bend under the weight of their bodies, and unless care is taken
they become bow-legged and distorted. Whenever there is a continued
deficiency of the earthy constituents, disease of the bones ensues.
Therefore, during childhood, and particularly during the period of
dentition, or teething, the food should be nutritious and at the same time
contain a due proportion of lime, which is preferable in the form of a
phosphate. When it cannot be furnished by the food, it should be supplied
artificially. Delayed, prolonged, and tedious dentition generally arises
from a deficiency of lime.</p>

<p>With the advance of age it accumulates, and the bone becomes hard,
inelastic, and capable of supporting heavy weights. Farther on, as in old
age, the animal matter of bone becomes diminished, and lime takes its
place, so that the bones become brittle and are easily broken. Lime exists
largely in hard water, and to a greater or less extent in milk, and in
nearly all foods except those of an acid character.</p>

<p><i>Phosphorus</i> exists in various combinations in different parts of
the body, particularly in the brain and nervous system. Persons who perform
a large amount of mental labor require <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[pg 238]</span>more phosphorus than those
engaged in other pursuits. It exists largely in the hulls of wheat, in
fish, and in eggs. It should enter to a considerable extent into the diet
of brain workers, and the bread consumed by them should be made of unbolted
flour.</p>

<p><i>Sulphur, Iron, Soda</i>, and <i>Potash</i> are all necessary in the
various tissues of the body, and deficiency of any one of them, for any
considerable length of time, results in disease. They are all supplied,
variously arranged and combined, in both animal and vegetable food; in some
articles they exist to a considerable extent, in others in much smaller
quantities. <i>Sulphur</i> exists in eggs and in the flesh of animals, and
often in water. <i>Iron</i> exists in the yolk of eggs, in flesh, and in
several vegetables. <i>Soda</i> is supplied in nearly all food, and largely
in common salt, which is a composition of sodium and hydrochloric acid, the
latter entering into the gastric juice. <i>Potash</i> exists, in some form
or other, in sufficient quantities for health, in both vegetable and animal
food.</p>

<p><b>Classes of Food</b>. All kinds of food substances may be divided into
four classes. <i>Proteids, Fats, Amyloids</i>, and <i>Minerals</i>.
Proteids are composed of the four elements, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and
nitrogen, sometimes combined with sulphur and phosphorus. In this class are
included the <i>gluten</i> of flour; the <i>albumen</i>, or white of eggs;
and the <i>serum</i> of the blood; the <i>fibrin</i> of the blood;
<i>syntonin</i>, the chief constituent of muscle and flesh, and
<i>casein</i>, one of the chief constituents of cheese, and many other
similar, but less frequent substances.</p>

<p>Fats are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen only, and contain more
hydrogen than would be required to form water if united with the oxygen
which they contain. All vegetable and animal oils and fatty matters are
included in this class.</p>

<p>Amyloids consist of substances which are also composed of carbon,
oxygen, and hydrogen only; but they contain just enough hydrogen to produce
water when combined with their oxygen, or two parts of hydrogen to one of
oxygen. This division includes <i>sugar, starch, dextrine</i>, and
<i>gum</i>. The above three classes of food-stuffs are only obtained
through the activity of living organisms, vegetable or animal, and have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[pg
239]</span>been, therefore, appropriately termed by Prof. Huxley, <i>vital
food-stuffs.</i></p>

<p>The mineral food-stuffs may, as we have seen, be procured from either
the living or the non-living world. They include water and various earthy,
metallic, and alkaline salts.</p>

<p><b>Variety of Food Necessary</b>. No substance can serve permanently for
food except it contains a certain quantity of proteid matter in the shape
of albumen, fibrin, casein, etc., and, on the other hand, any substance
containing proteid matter in a shape in which it can be readily
assimilated, may serve as a permanent vital food-stuff. Every substance,
which is to serve as a permanent food, must contain a sufficient quantity,
ready-made, of this most important and complex constituent of the body. In
addition, it must also contain a sufficient quantity of the mineral
ingredients which enter into the composition of the body. Its power of
supporting life and maintaining the weight and composition of the body
remains unaltered, whether it contains fats or amyloids or not. The
secretion of urea, and, consequently, the loss of nitrogen, goes on
continually, and the body, therefore, must necessarily waste unless the
supply of proteid matter is constantly renewed, since this is the only
class of foods that contains nitrogen in any considerable quantity. There
can be no absolute necessity for any other food-stuffs but those containing
the proteid and mineral elements of the body. From what has been said, it
will readily be seen that whether an animal be carnivorous or herbivorous,
it begins to starve as soon as its vital food-stuffs consist only of
amyloids, or fats, or both. It suffers from what has been termed
<i>nitrogen starvation,</i> and if proteid matters are withheld entirely,
it soon dies. In such a case, and still more in the case of an animal which
is entirely deprived of vital food, the organism, as long as it continues
to live, feeds upon itself, the waste products necessarily being formed at
the expense of its own body.</p>

<p>Although proteid matter is the essential element of food, and under
certain circumstances may be sufficient of itself to support the body, it
is a very uneconomical food. The white of an egg, which may be taken as a
type of the proteids, contains about fifteen per cent. of nitrogen, and
fifty-three per cent. of carbon; therefore, a man feeding upon this, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[pg
240]</span>take in about three and a half times as much carbon as nitrogen.
It has been proved that a healthy, adult man, taking a fair amount of
exercise and maintaining his weight and body temperature, eliminates about
thirteen times as much carbon as nitrogen. However, if he is to get his
necessary quantity, about 4000 grains of carbon, out of albumen, he must
eat 7,547 grains of that substance; but this quantity of albumen contains
nearly four times as much nitrogen as he requires. In other words, it takes
about four pounds of lean meat, free from fat, to furnish 4,000 grains of
carbon, the quantity required, whereas one pound yields the requisite
quantity of nitrogen. Thus a man restricted exclusively to a proteid diet,
must take an enormous quantity of it. This would involve a large amount of
unnecessary physiological labor, to comminute, dissolve, and absorb the
food, and to excrete the superfluous nitrogenous matter. Unproductive labor
should be avoided as much in physiological as in political economy. The
universal practice of subsisting on a mixed diet, in which proteids are
mixed with fats or amyloids, is therefore justifiable.</p>

<p>Fats contain about 80 per cent. of carbon, and amyloids about 40 per
cent. We have seen that there is sufficient nitrogen in a pound of meat
free from fat, to supply a healthy adult man for twenty-four hours, but
that it contains only one-fourth of the quantity of carbon required. About
half a pound of fat, or one pound of sugar, will supply the quantity of
carbon necessary. The fat, if properly subdivided, and the sugar, by reason
of its solubility, pass with great ease into the circulation, the
physiological labor, consequently, being reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>Several common articles of diet contain in themselves all the necessary
elements. Thus, butchers' meat ordinarily contains from 30 to 50 per cent.
of fat; and bread contains the proteid, gluten, and the amyloids, starch
and sugar, together with minute quantities of fat. However, on account of
the proportion in which these proteid and other components of the body
exist in these substances, neither of them, by itself is such a
physiologically economical food, as it is when combined with the other in
the proportion of three to eight, or three quarters of a pound of meat to
two pounds of bread a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[pg
241]</span>It is evident that a variety of food is necessary for health.
Animals fed exclusively upon one class, or upon a single article of diet,
droop and die; and in the human family we know that the constant use of one
kind of diet causes disgust, even when not very long continued.
Consequently, we infer that the welfare of man demands that his food be of
sufficient variety to supply his body with all of its component parts. If
this is not done the appetite is deranged, and often craves the very
article which is necessary to supply the deficiency. After the component
parts of the organism have assimilated the nutritious elements of
particular kinds of food for a certain length of time, they lose the power
of effecting the necessary changes for proper nutrition, and a supply of
other material is imperatively demanded. When the diet has been long
restricted to proteids, consisting largely of salt meats, fresh vegetables
and fruits containing the organic acids, become indispensable; otherwise,
the scorbutic condition, or scurvy, is almost sure to be developed. Fresh
vegetables and fruits should be eaten in considerable quantities at the
proper seasons.</p>

<p><b>Value Of Animal Food</b>. The principal animal food used in this
country consists of <i>Pork, Mutton, Beef</i>, and <i>Fish</i>. Beef and
mutton are rich in muscle-producing material. Although pork is extensively
produced in some portions of this country, and enters largely into the diet
of some classes, yet its use, except in winter, is not to be encouraged.
The same amount of beef would give far greater returns in muscular
power.</p>

<p>In addition to the meats mentioned, <i>Wild Game</i> furnishes
palatable, nutritious, and easily-digested food. <i>Domestic Fowls</i>,
when young, are excellent, and with the exception of geese and ducks, are
easily digested. <i>Wild Birds</i> are considered much healthier food than
those which are domesticated. All of these contain more or less of the
elements which enter into the composition of the four classes of foods.</p>

<p><b>Vegetable Foods</b>. <i>Wheat</i> is rich in all the elements which
compose the four classes, and, when the flour is unbolted, it is one of the
best articles for supplying all the elements.</p>

<p><i>Barley</i> stands next to wheat in nourishing qualities, but is not
so palatable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[pg
242]</span><i>Oats</i> are rich in all the elements necessary for
nutrition. Oatmeal is a favorite article of diet among the Scotch, and,
judging from their hardy constitutions, their choice is well founded. In
consequence of the large proportion of phosphorus which they contain, they
are capable of furnishing a large amount of nourishment for the brain.</p>

<p><i>Rye</i> is nutritious, but it is not so rich in tissue-forming
material.</p>

<p><i>Indian Corn</i> is an article well known and extensively used
throughout the United States, and is a truly valuable one, capable of being
prepared in a great variety of ways for food. It contains more carbon than
wheat, and less nitrogen and phosphorus, though enough of both to be
extremely valuable.</p>

<p><i>Rice</i> is rather meagre in nutriment; it contains but little
phosphorous matter, with less carbon than other cereals, and is best and
most generally employed as a diet in tropical countries.</p>

<p><i>Beans and Peas</i> are rich in nutritious matter, and furnish the
manual laborer with a cheap and wholesome diet.</p>

<p>The <i>Potato</i> is the most valuable of all fresh vegetables grown in
temperate climates. Its flavor is very agreeable, and it contains very
important nutritive and medicinal qualities, and is eaten almost daily by
nearly every family in North America. Until very recently it, with the
addition of a little butter-milk or skim-milk, constituted almost the sole
diet of the Irish people. The average composition of the potato is stated
by Dr. Smith to be as follows: Water 75 per cent., nitrogen 2.1, starch
18.8, sugar 3.2, fat 0.2, salts 0.7. The relative values of different
potatoes may be ascertained very correctly by weighing them in the hand,
for the heavier the tuber the more starch it contains.</p>

<p><i>Turnip and Cabbage</i> are 92.5 per cent. water, and, consequently,
poor in nutrition, though they are very palatable. The solid portions of
cabbage, however, are rich in albumen.</p>

<p>It is evident that the quantity necessary to maintain the system in
proper condition must be greatly modified by the habits of life, the
condition of the organism, the age, the sex, and the climate. The daily
loss of substance which must be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243"
id="Page_243"></a>[pg 243]</span>replaced by material from without, as we
have seen, is very great. In addition to the loss of carbon and nitrogen,
about four and a half pounds of water are removed from the system in
twenty-four hours, and it is necessary that about this quantity should be
introduced into the system in some form or other, however much it may be
adulterated. Professor Dalton states: "From experiments performed while
living on an exclusive diet of bread, fresh meat, and butter, with coffee
and water for drink, we have found that the entire quantity of food
required during twenty-four hours by a man in full health and taking free
exercise in the open air is as follows:</p>

<table align='center' border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' summary=''>
<tr><td align='left'>Meat,</td><td align='left'>16 oz., or</td><td
align='left'>11.03 lb. avoir.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Bread,</td><td align='left'>19 "</td><td
align='left'>1.19 "</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Butter or fat,</td><td align='left'>3 "</td><td
align='left'>0.22 "</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Water,</td><td align='left'>52 fluid oz.,</td><td
align='left'>3.38 "</td></tr>
</table>

<p>That is to say, rather less than two and a half pounds of solid food,
and rather over three pounds of liquid food."</p>

<p><b>Climate</b> exerts an important influence on the quantity and quality
of food required by the system. In northern latitudes the inhabitants are
exposed to extreme cold and require an abundant supply of food, and
especially that which contains a large amount of fat. On this account fat
meat is taken in large quantities and with a relish. The quantity of food
consumed by the natives of the Arctic zone is almost incredible. The
Russian Admiral, Saritcheff, relates that one of the Esquimaux in his
presence devoured a mass of boiled rice and butter which weighed
twenty-eight pounds, at a single meal, and Dr. Hayes states that usually
the daily ration of an Esquimau is from twelve to fifteen pounds of meat,
one-third of which is fat, and on one occasion he saw a man eat ten pounds
of walrus flesh at a single meal. The intense cold creates a constant
craving for fatty articles of food, and some members of his own party were
in the habit of drinking the contents of the oil-kettle with great apparent
relish.</p>

<p><b>Digestibility of Food</b>. Unless an article of diet can be digested
it is of no value, no matter how rich it may be in nutriment. The quantity
of food taken, will influence to a considerable extent, the time consumed
in its digestion. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244"
id="Page_244"></a>[pg 244]</span>stomachs of all are not alike in this
respect, and the subject of time has been a difficult one to determine. The
experiments of Dr. Beaumont with the Canadian, St. Martin, who accidentally
discharged the contents of a loaded gun into his stomach, creating an
external opening through which the process of digestion could be observed,
have furnished us with the following table, which is correct enough to show
relatively, if not absolutely, the time required for the digestion of
various articles:</p>

<p>Milk is more easily digested than almost any other article of food. It
is very nutritious, and, on account of the variety of the elements which it
contains, it is extremely valuable an <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[pg 246]</span>article of diet,
especially when the digestive powers are weakened, as in fevers, or during
convalescence from any acute disease. Eggs are also very nutritious and
easily digested. Whipped eggs are digested and assimilated with great ease.
Fish, as a rule, are more speedily digested than is the flesh of
warm-blooded animals. Oysters, especially when taken raw, are very easily
digested. We have known dyspeptics who were unable to digest any other kind
of animal food, to subsist for a considerable period upon raw oysters. The
flesh of mammalia seems to be more easily digested than that of birds.
Beef, mutton, lamb, and venison are easily digested, while fat roast pork
and veal are digested with difficulty. According to the foregoing table
vegetables were digested in about the same time as ordinary animal food,
but it should be remembered that a great part of the digestion of these is
effected in the small intestine. Soups are, as a rule, very quickly
digested. The time required for the digestion of bread is about the same as
that required for the digestion of ordinary meats. Boiled cabbage is one of
the most difficult substances to digest.</p>

<p><b>Cookery</b>. "Cookery," says Mrs. Owen, "Is the art of turning every
morsel to the best use; it is the exercise of skill, thought, and ingenuity
to make every particle of food yield the utmost nourishment and pleasure,
of which it is capable." We are indebted to this practical woman for many
valuable suggestions in this art; and some of our recommendations are drawn
from her experience.</p>

<p><b>Soups</b>. The nutritious properties, tone, and sweetness of soup
depend in the first place upon the freshness and quality of the meat;
secondly on the manner in which it is boiled. Soups should be nicely and
delicately seasoned, according to the taste of the consumer, by using
parsley, sage, savory, thyme, sweet marjoram, sweet basil, or any of the
vegetable condiments. These may be raised in the garden, or obtained at the
drug stores, sifted and prepared for use. In extracting the juices of
meats, in order that soups may be most nutritious, it is important that the
meat be put into <i>cold</i> water, or that which is not so hot as to
coagulate the albumen (which would prevent it from being extracted), and
then, by slow heat and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247"
id="Page_247"></a>[pg 247]</span>a simmering process, the most nutritious
properties will be brought out.</p>

<p><b>Beef Soup</b> may be made of any bone of the beef, by putting it into
cold water, adding a little salt, and skimming it well just before it
boils. If a vegetable flavor be desired, celery, carrots, onions, turnips,
cabbage, or potatoes, may be added, in sufficient quantities to suit the
taste.</p>

<p><b>Mutton Soup</b> may be made from the fore-quarter, in the same manner
as described above, thickened with pearl-barley or rice, and flavored to
suit the taste.</p>

<p><b>Boiled Fish.</b> Clean the fish nicely, then sprinkle flour on a
cloth and wrap it around them; salt the water, and, when it boils, put in
the fish; let them boil half an hour, then carefully remove them to a
platter, adding egg sauce and parsley. To <i>bake fish</i>, prepare by
cleaning, scaling, etc., and let them remain in salt water for a short
time. Make a stuffing of the crumbs of light bread, and add to it a little
salt, pepper, butter, and sweet herbs, and stir with a spoon. Then fill the
fish with the stuffing and sew it up. Put on butter, salt, pepper, and
flour, having enough water in the dish to keep it from burning, and baste
often. A four pound fish will bake in fifty or sixty minutes.</p>

<p><b>Broiled Steak.</b> Sirloin and porter-house steaks should be broiled
quickly. Preserve them on ice for a day or two and their tenderness is much
increased. Never broil them until the meal is ready to be served.</p>

<p><b>Boiled Meat.</b> When meat is to be boiled for <i>eating,</i> put it
into boiling water, by which its juices are coagulated and its richness
preserved. The slower it boils, the more tender, plump, and white it will
be. Meat should be removed as soon as done, or it will lose its flavor and
become soggy.</p>

<p><b>Pork Steaks.</b> The best steaks are cut off the shoulder&mdash;ham steaks
being rather too dry. They should be well fried, in order to destroy the
little living parasites, called Trichin&aelig; which sometimes infest this kind
of meat. They are introduced into the stomach by eating ham, pork, or
sausages made from the flesh of hogs infested by them. Thorough cooking
destroys them, and those who will persist in the use of swine's flesh can
afford to have it "<i>done brown.</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[pg
248]</span><b>Baked Mutton.</b> To bake mutton well, a person should have a
brisk, sharp fire, and keep the meat well basted. It requires two hours to
bake a leg of mutton, weighing eight pounds.</p>

<p><b>Bread.</b> The health and happiness of a family depend, to a certain
extent, on good, well-baked bread. At all events, our enjoyment would be
greater if it were only better prepared. We make the following extract from
an article printed by the State Board of Health, concerning the food of the
people of Massachusetts: "As an example of good bread we would mention that
which is always to be had at the restaurant of Parker's Hotel, in Boston.
It is not better than is found on the continent of Europe on all the great
lines of travel, and in common use by millions of people in Germany and
France; but with us, it is a rare example of what bread may be. It is made
from a mixture of flour, such as is generally sold in our markets, water,
salt, and yeast&mdash;nothing else. The yeast is made from malt, potatoes, and
hops. <i>The dough is kneaded from one and a half to two hours, and is then
thoroughly baked."</i> The truth seems to be that the kneading, which in
this country takes the housewife's time and muscle, in Europe is done by
the help of machinery. So here, in large villages and cities, people might
furnish themselves with good bread, by means of co-operative associations,
even at a less cost than at present.</p>


<h4>BEVERAGES.</h4>


<p><b>Water</b>. The importance of water in the economy of nature is
obvious to all. It is the most abundant substance of which we have
knowledge. It composes four-fifths of the weight of vegetables, and
three-fourths of that of animals. It is essential to the continuance of
organic life. Water is universally present in all of the tissues and fluids
of the body. It is not only abundant in the blood and secretions, but it is
also an ingredient of the solids of the body. According to the most
accurate computations, water is found to constitute from two-thirds to
three-fourths of the entire weight of the human body. The following table,
compiled by Robin and Verdeil, shows the proportion of water per thousand
parts in different solids and fluids:</p>

<p><b>The Natural Drink of Man.</b> Water constitutes the natural drink of
man. No other liquid can supply its place. Its presence, however, in the
body is not permanent. It is discharged from the body in different ways; by
the urine, the feces, the breath, and the perspiration. In the first two,
it is in a liquid form, in the others in a vaporous form. It is estimated
that about forty-eight per cent. is discharged in the liquid, and fifty-two
per cent. in the vaporous form; but the absolute as well as the relative
amount discharged depends upon a variety of circumstances.</p>

<p>Water is never found perfectly pure, since it holds in solution more or
less of almost every substance with, which it comes in contact. Rain
falling in the country remote from habitations is the purest water that
nature furnishes, for it is then only charged with the natural gases of the
atmosphere. In cities it absorbs organic and gaseous impurities, as it
falls through the air, and flowing over roofs of houses carries with it
soot and dust. Water from melted snow is purer than rain-water, since it
descends in a solid form, and is therefore incapable of absorbing gases.
Rain-water is not adapted to drinking purposes, unless well filtered. All
water, except that which has been distilled, contains air, and it is due to
this fact, that aquatic animals can live in it; for example, put a fish in
distilled water and it will soon die.</p>

<p><b>Mineral Impurities.</b> Rain-water, which has filtered through the
soil and strata of the earth, dissolves the soluble materials, and carries
them down to lower levels, until they finally collect in the sea. Common
well, spring, and mineral waters contain from 5 to 60 grains to the gallon;
sea-water contains 2,000 grains while in some parts of the Dead Sea there
are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[pg
250]</span>20,000 grams to the gallon. The principal mineral impurities of
well and spring water are lime, magnesia, soda, and oxide of iron, combined
with carbonic and sulphuric acids, forming carbonates, sulphates, and
chloride of sodium, or common salt. The most general, however, are
carbonate and sulphate of lime.</p>

<p>Mineral waters are usually obtained from springs which contain a
considerable amount of saline matter. Those waters which abound in salts of
iron are called <i>chalybeate</i> or <i>ferruginous</i>. Those containing
salt are termed <i>saline</i>. Those in which contain sulphur are termed
<i>sulphurous</i>. Water derives the quality of hardness from the salts of
lime&mdash;chiefly the sulphates&mdash;which it contains. Hard water, being an
imperfect solvent, is unsuitable for washing purposes. There are two
varieties of hardness, one of which is temporary, being due to the presence
of carbonic acid gas in the water which holds the salts in solution and may
be removed by merely boiling the water and thus expelling the gas when the
salts are deposited, while the other is permanent and can only be removed
by the distillation of the water. It has been ascertained that twelve
pounds of the best hard soap must be added to 10,000 gallons of water of
one degree of hardness before a lather will remain and, consequently, 0.12
lb. to 100 gallons of water is a measure of one degree of hardness. Since
hard water is not so useful in cooking and other domestic purposes, as soft
water, causing a great waste of labor and material, it is often highly
desirable to soften it, which is effected by the addition of lime in what
is known as <i>Clark's process</i>. One ounce of quicklime should be added
to 1000 gallons of water for each degree of hardness. It should be first
slacked and stirred up in a few gallons and then thoroughly mixed with the
entire quantity. Then it should be allowed to remain, and will become clear
in about three hours, but should not be drunk for twelve hours.</p>

<p>The purity of drinking water is a matter of much importance. That which
contains a minute quantity of lead will give rise to all the symptoms of
lead poisoning, if the use of it be sufficiently prolonged. An account is
given of the poisoning of the royal family of France, many of whom suffered
from this cause when in exile at Claremont. The amount of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[pg 251]</span>lead
was only one grain in the gallon. Care should therefore be taken to avoid
drinking the water which has been contained in leaden pipes. It should
always be allowed to run a few minutes before being used.</p>

<p>An excess of saline ingredients, which in small quantities are harmless,
frequently produces marked disorders of the digestive organs. A small
amount of putrescent matter habitually introduced into the system, as in
the use of food, is productive of the most serious results, which can be
traced to the direct action of the poison introduced. A case is recorded of
a certain locality favorably situated with regard to the access of pure
air, where an epidemic of fever broke out much to the astonishment of the
inhabitants. Upon observation it was found that the attacks of fever were
limited to those families who used water from a neighboring well. The
disagreeable taste of the water which had been observed, was subsequently
traced to the bursting of a sewer, which had discharged a part of its
contents into the well. When the cause was removed, there was no recurrence
of the evil effects.</p>

<p><b>Organic Impurities.</b> "Water is liable to organic contamination
from a multitude of causes, such as drainage from dwellings, dust, insects,
the decaying of vegetable and animal matter. These impurities may be
mechanically suspended or held in solution in the water. Although organic
impurities, which are mechanically suspended in water, are poisonous, yet
they are generally associated with animalculea, and these feed upon, and
finally consume them. Good water never contains animalcul&aelig;. They are
never found in freshly fallen rain-water, remote from dwellings, but
abound, to a greater or less extent in cisterns, marshes, ponds, and
rivers. These little workers serve a useful purpose since they consume the
dead organic matter from the water, and, having fulfilled their mission,
sink to the bottom and die. Water which contains organic matter is
exceedingly dangerous to health, and its use should be carefully
avoided.</p>

<p>In low lands where the current of streams is sluggish, and shallow pools
abound, the water is apt to be more or less infected with decaying
vegetable substances. Many people living in such localities, and wishing to
obtain water with as little <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252"
id="Page_252"></a>[pg 252]</span>trouble as possible, dig a hole in the
ground, a few feet in depth, and allow the stagnant surface water to
accumulate. This water is used for drinking and cooking. The result is that
ague prevails in such localities.</p>

<p>Care should be taken that wells, from which the water is used for
household purposes, are located at a distance from barn-yards, privies,
sinks, vaults, and stagnant pools.</p>

<p><b>Purification of Water.</b> There are various methods of purifying
water. It may be accomplished by distillation, which is the most perfect
method; by filtration through sand, crushed charcoal, and other porous
substances, which deprives it of suspended impurities and living organisms;
by boiling, which destroys the vitality of all animal and vegetable
matters, drives out the gases and precipitates carbonate of lime, which
composes the crust frequently seen upon the inside of tea-kettles or
boilers; by the use of chemical agents, which may be employed to destroy or
precipitate the deleterious substances. Alum is often used to cleanse roily
water, two or three grains in solution, being sufficient for a quart. It
causes the impurities to settle to the bottom, so that the clear water can
be poured or dipped out for use. One or two grains of the permanganate of
potassium will render wholesome a gallon of water containing animal
impurities.</p>

<p><b>How to Use Water</b>. Very little if any water should be taken at
meal time, since the salivary glands furnish an abundance of watery fluid
to assist in mastication. When these glands are aided with water to "wash
down" the food, their functions become feeble and impaired. The gastric
juice is diluted and digestion is weakened. Large draughts of cold water
ought never to be indulged in, since they cause derangement of the stomach.
When the body is overheated, the use of much water is injurious. It should
only be taken in small quantities. Thirst may be partially allayed, without
injury, by holding cold water in the mouth for a short time and then
spitting it out, taking care to swallow but very little. Travelers
frequently experience inconvenience from change of water. If the means are
at hand, let them purify their drinking water, if not, they should drink as
little as possible. Persons who visit the banks of the Ohio, Missouri, or
Mississippi rivers and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253"
id="Page_253"></a>[pg 253]</span>similar localities, almost invariably
suffer from some form of gastric or intestinal disease. Water standing in
close rooms soon becomes unfit to drink and should not be used. A drink of
cold water taken on going to bed, and another on rising are conducive to
health, especially in the case of persons troubled with constipation.
"<i>Drink water</i>" said the celebrated Dubois to the young persons who
consulted him, "<i>drink water, I tell you!</i>" Du Moulin, the great
medical authority of his time, wrote, just previous to his death, "<i>I
leave two great physicians behind me&mdash;diet and water</i>."</p>

<p><b>Tea and Coffee.</b> These substances are almost universally used as
beverages, and when properly employed, serve a four-fold purpose: they
quench thirst, excite an agreeable exhilaration, repress the waste of the
system, and supply nourishment. In consequence of being generally used at
meal times, their stimulant properties are employed to promote digestion,
and consequently they are not so objectionable as they might otherwise be.
The liquids introduced into the stomach at meal times should not be cold.
Tea and coffee are drunk warm, while water, except in a few instances, is
always drunk cold, the effects of which have already been shown. That their
inordinate use may be injurious no body can deny, but this is equally true
of other beverages, even pure, cold water. Scientific investigators inform
us that the use of these agents as beverages, when judiciously employed, is
not injurious. It has been urged that they are poisonous, but if they are,
they are very slow in their operation.</p>

<p>When properly prepared, they are very agreeable beverages, and as man
will drink more or less at meals, they are allowable; for if their use were
excluded, some other beverage would be sought after, and quite likely one
of an alcoholic character employed, so of two evils, if this be an evil,
let us choose the least. Unlike alcoholic stimulants, they exhilarate
without a depressing reaction after their influence has passed off. But one
cup should be drunk at a meal, and it should be of moderate strength. The
use of large quantities of drink at meals retards digestion by diluting the
digestive fluids. The excessive use of large quantities of strong tea or
coffee stimulates the brain and causes wakefulness, and produces
irritability <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[pg
254]</span>of the nervous system. When they are productive of such effects,
their use is injurious, and should be considerably moderated or wholly
discontinued. No criterion can be given by which the amount the system will
tolerate can be regulated. What one person may take with impunity, may be
deleterious to an other. Individuals differ greatly in this respect. There
are some who cannot tolerate them at all, either because of some
peculiarity of constitution, or on account of disease. And sometimes when
tea is agreeable and beneficial, coffee disagrees with the individual and
<i>vice versa.</i> Persons of nervous habits whether natural or acquired,
are apt to find their wakefulness and irritability increased by the use of
tea, particularly if strong, while coffee will have a tranquilizing effect.
Persons of a lymphatic or bilious temperament often find that coffee
disagrees with them, aggravating their troubles and causing biliousness,
constipation, and headache, while tea proves agreeable and beneficial.
Whenever they disagree with the system, the best rule is to abandon their
use. We find many persons who do not use either, and yet enjoy health, a
fact which proves that they are not by any means indispensable, and, no
doubt, were it customary to go without them, their absence would be but
slightly missed.</p>

<p>Tea and coffee are adulterated to a very great extent, and persons using
them will be greatly imposed upon. This is an evil we cannot remedy. If
people make use of them, their experience in selecting them must be their
guide; however, it is believed that the Black and Japan varieties of tea
are the least apt to be adulterated, and coffee, to insure purity, should
be purchased in the berry, and ground by the purchaser.</p>

<p>In preparing tea an infusion should be made by adding boiling water to
the leaves, and permitting them to steep for a few minutes only, for a
concentrated decoction, made by boiling for a long time, liberates the
astringent and bitter principles and drives off the agreeable aroma which
resides in a volatile oil.</p>

<p>Coffee should be prepared by adding cold water to the ground berry, and
raising it slowly to the boiling point. Long-continued boiling liberates
the astringent and bitter principles upon which its stimulant effects to a
great extent depend, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255"
id="Page_255"></a>[pg 255]</span>drives off with the steam the aromatic oil
from which the agreeable taste is derived.</p>


<h4>ALCOHOLIC LIQUORS.</h4>


<p>These are divided into three classes: malted, fermented, and distilled.
They all contain more or less alcohol, and their effects are, therefore, in
some respects similar, and, in the words of Dr. B.W. Richardson, the great
English authority on hygiene: "To say this man only drinks ale, that man
only drinks wine, while a third drinks spirits, is merely to say, when the
apology is unclothed, that all drink the same danger. * * Alcohol is a
universal intoxicant, and in the higher orders of animals is capable of
inducing the most systematic phenomena of disease. But it is reserved for
man himself to exhibit these phenomena in their purest form, and to
present, through them, in the morbid conditions belonging to his age, a
distinct pathology. Bad as this is, it might be worse; for if the evils of
alcohol were made to extend equally to animals lower than man, we should
soon have, none that were tameable, none that were workable, and none that
were eatable." Researches have shown that the proportion of half a drachm
of alcohol to the pound weight of the body, is the quantity which usually
produces intoxication, and that an increase of this amount to one drachm
immediately endangers the life of the individual. The first symptom which
attracts attention, when alcohol commences to take effect upon the body, is
an increase in the number of the pulsations of the heart. Dr. Parkes and
Count Wolowicz conducted a series of interesting experiments on young adult
men. They counted the pulsations of the heart, at regular intervals, during
periods when the subject drank only water; and then they counted the beats
of the heart in the same individual during successive periods in which
alcohol was drunk in increasing quantities.</p>

<p>The following details are taken from their report:</p>

<p>"The highest of the daily means of the pulse observed during the first
or water period was 77.5; but on this day two observations were deficient.
The next highest daily mean was 77 beats.</p>

<p>If instead of the mean of the eight days, or 73.57, we <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>[pg 256]</span>compare
the mean of this one day, viz., 77 beats per minute, with the alcoholic
days, so as to be sure not to over-estimate the action of the alcohol, we
find:</p>

<blockquote>
On the ninth day, with one fluid ounce of alcohol,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the heart beat 430 times more.<br />
On the tenth day, with two fluid ounces, 1,872 times more.<br />
On the eleventh day, with four fluid ounces, 12,960 times more.<br />
On the twelfth day, with six fluid ounces, 30,672 times more.<br />
On the thirteenth day, with eight fluid ounces, 23,904 times more.<br />
On the fourteenth day, with eight fluid ounces, 25,488 times more.<br />
</blockquote>

<p>But as there was ephemeral fever on the twelfth day, it is right to make
a deduction, and to estimate the number of beats in that day as midway
between the twelfth and twenty-third days, or 18,432. Adopting this, the
mean daily excess of beats during the alcoholic days was 14,492, or an
increase of rather more than thirteen per cent.</p>

<p>The first day of alcohol gave an excess of one per cent., and the last
of twenty-three per cent.; and the mean of these two gives almost the same
percentage of excess as the mean of the six days.</p>

<p>Admitting that each beat of the heart was as strong during the alcoholic
as in the water period (and it was really more powerful), the heart on the
last two days of alcohol was doing one-fifth more work.</p>

<p>Adopting the lowest estimate which has been given of the daily work done
by the heart, viz., as equal to 122 tons lifted one foot, the heart, during
the alcoholic period, did daily work in excess equal to lifting 15.8 tons
one foot, and in the last two days did extra work to the amount of
twenty-four tons lifted as far.</p>

<p>The period of rest for the heart was shortened, though, perhaps, not to
such an extent as would be inferred from the number of beats; for each
contraction was sooner over. The beat on the fifth and sixth days after
alcohol was left off, and apparently at the time when the last traces of
alcohol were eliminated, showed, in the sphygmographic tracing, signs of
unusual feebleness; and, perhaps, in consequence of this, when the brandy
quickened the heart again, the tracing showed a more rapid contraction of
the ventricles, but less power than <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>[pg 257]</span>in the alcoholic period.
The brandy acted, in fact, on a heart whose nutrition had not been
perfectly restored."</p>

<p>The flush often seen on the cheeks of those who are under the influence
of alcoholic liquors, and which is produced by a relaxed and distended
condition of the superficial blood vessels, is erroneously supposed by many
to merely extend to the parts exposed to view. On this subject, Dr.
Richardson says: "If the lungs could be seen, they, too, would be found
with their vessels injected; if the brain and spinal cord could be laid
open to view, they would be discovered in the same condition; if the
stomach, the liver, the spleen, the kidneys, or any other vascular organs
or parts could be laid open to the eye, the vascular engorgement would be
equally manifest. In the lower animals I have been able to witness this
extreme vascular condition in the lungs, and once I had the unusual, though
unhappy opportunity of observing the same phenomenon in the brain of a man
who, in a paroxysm of alcoholic delirium, cast himself under the wheels of
a railway carriage. The brain, instantaneously thrown out from the skull by
the crash, was before me within three minutes after the accident. It
exhaled the odor of spirit most distinctly, and its membranes and minute
structures were vascular in the extreme. It looked as if it had been
recently injected with vermilion injection. The white matter of the
cerebrum, studded with red points, could scarcely be distinguished when it
was incised, it was so preternaturally red; and the pia mater, or internal
vascular membrane covering the brain, resembled a delicate web of
coagulated red blood, so tensely were its fine vessels engorged. This
condition extended through both the larger and the smaller brain, cerebrum,
and cerebellum, but was not so marked in the medulla, or commencing portion
of the spinal cord, as in the other portions.</p>

<p>In course of time, in persons accustomed to alcohol, the vascular
changes, temporary only in the novitiate, become confirmed and permanent.
The bloom on the nose which characterizes the genial toper is the
established sign of alcoholic action on the vascular structure.</p>

<p>Recently, physiological research has served to explain the reason why,
under alcohol the heart at first beats so quickly, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[pg 258]</span>why the pulse rises, and
why the minute blood-vessels become so strongly injected.</p>

<p>At one time it was imagined that alcohol acts immediately upon the heart
by stimulating it to increased motion; and from this idea,&mdash;false idea, I
should say,&mdash;of the primary action of alcohol, many erroneous conclusions
have been drawn. We have now learned that there exist many chemical bodies
which act in the same manner as alcohol, and that their effect is not to
stimulate the heart, but to weaken the contractile force of the extreme and
minute vessels which the heart fills with blood at each of its strokes.
These bodies produce, in fact, a paralysis of the organic nervous supply of
the vessels which constitute the minute vascular structures. The minute
vessels when paralysed offer inefficient resistance to the force of the
heart, and the pulsating organ thus liberated, like the main-spring of a
clock from which the resistance has been removed, quickens in action,
dilating the feebly resistant vessels, and giving evidence really not of
increased, but of wasted power."</p>

<p>The continued use of alcoholic liquors in any considerable quantity
produces irritation and inflammation of the stomach, and structural disease
of the liver. Dr. Hammond has shown that alcohol has a special affinity for
nervous matter, and is, therefore, found in greater quantity in the brain
and spinal cord than elsewhere in the body. The gray matter of the brain
undergoes, to a certain extent, a fatty degeneration, and there is a
shrinking of the whole cerebrum, with impairment of the intellectual
faculties, muscular tremor, and a shambling gait.</p>

<p>Large doses of alcohol cause a diminution of the temperature of the
body, which in fevers is more marked than in the normal state.</p>

<p>In addition to the organic diseases enumerated above, and delirium
tremens, the following diseases are frequently the result of the excessive
use of alcoholic liquors: epilepsy, paralysis, insanity, diabetes, gravel,
and diseases of the heart and blood-vessels.</p>

<p>The physiological deductions of Dr. Richardson are so much in accord
with our own that we quote them in full:</p>

<p>"In the first place we gather from the physiological reading of the
action of alcohol that the agent is narcotic. I have <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[pg
259]</span>compared it throughout to chloroform, and the comparison is good
in all respects save one, viz.: that alcohol is less fatal than chloroform
as an instant destroyer. It kills certainly in its own way, but its method
of killing is slow, indirect, and by disease.</p>

<p>The well-proven fact that alcohol, when it is taken into the body,
reduces the animal temperature, is full of the most important suggestions.
The fact shows that alcohol does not in any sense act as a supplier of
vital heat as is commonly supposed, and that it does not prevent the loss
of heat as those imagine 'who take just a drop to keep out the cold,' It
shows, on the contrary, that cold and alcohol, in their effects on the
body, run closely together, an opinion confirmed by the experience of those
who live or travel in cold regions of the earth. The experiences of the
Arctic voyagers, of the leaders of the great Napoleonic campaigns in
Russia, of the good monks of St. Bernard, all testify that death from cold
is accelerated by its ally alcohol. Experiments with alcohol in extreme
cold tell the like story, while the chilliness of the body which succeeds
upon even a moderate excess of alcoholic indulgence leads directly to the
same indication of truth.</p>

<p>The conclusive evidence now in our possession that alcohol taken into
the animal body sets free the heart, so as to cause the excess of motion of
which the record has been given above, is proof that the heart, under the
frequent influence of alcohol, must undergo deleterious change of
structure. It may, indeed, be admitted in proper fairness, that when the
heart is passing through these rapid movements it is working under less
pressure than when its movements are slow and natural; and this allowance
must needs be made, or the inference would be that the organ ought to stop
at once, in function, by the excess of strain put upon it. At the same time
the excess of motion is injurious to the heart and to the body at large; it
subjects the heart to irregularity of supply of blood, it subjects the body
in all its parts to the same injurious influence; it weakens, and, as a
necessary sequence, degrades both the heart and the body.</p>

<p>Speaking honestly, I cannot, by any argument yet presented to me, admit
the alcohols by any sign that should distinguish them from other chemical
substances of the paralysing narcotic class. When it is physiologically
understood that what is called <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260"
id="Page_260"></a>[pg 260]</span>stimulation or excitement is, in absolute
fact, a relaxation, a partial paralysis, of one of the most important
mechanisms in the animal body, the minute, resisting, compensating
circulation, we grasp quickly the error in respect to the action of
stimulants in which we have been educated, and obtain a clear solution of
the well-known experience that all excitement, all passion, leaves, after
its departure, lowness of heart, depression of mind, sadness of spirit. We
learn, then, in respect to alcohol, that the temporary excitement it
produces is at the expense of the animal force, and that the ideas of its
being necessary to resort to it, that it may lift up the forces of the
animal body into true and firm and even activity, or that it may add
something useful to the living tissues, are errors as solemn as they are
widely disseminated. In the scientific education of the people no fact is
more deserving of special comment than this fact, that excitement is wasted
force, the running down of the animal mechanism before it has served out
its time of motion.</p>

<p>It will be said that alcohol cheers the weary, and that to take a little
wine for the stomach's sake is one of the lessons that comes from the deep
recesses of human nature. I am not so obstinate as to deny this argument,
There are times in the life of man when the heart is oppressed, when the
resistance to its motion is excessive, and when blood flows languidly to
the centres of life, nervous and muscular. In these moments alcohol cheers.
It lets loose the heart from its oppression; it lets flow a brisker current
of blood into the failing organs; it aids nutritive changes, and altogether
is of temporary service to man. So far, alcohol may be good, and if its use
could be limited to this one action, this one purpose, it would be amongst
the most excellent of the gifts of science to mankind. Unhappily, the
border line between this use and the abuse of it, the temptation to extend
beyond the use, the habit to apply the use when it is not wanted as readily
as when it is wanted, overbalance, in the multitude of men, the temporary
value that attaches truly to alcohol as a physiological agent. Hence
alcohol becomes a dangerous instrument even in the hands of the strong and
wise, a murderous instrument in the hands of the foolish and weak. Used too
frequently, used too excessively, this agent, which in moderation cheers
the failing body, relaxes its vessels too <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[pg 261]</span>extremely; spoils vital
organs; makes the force of the circulation slow, imperfect, irregular;
suggests the call for more stimulation; tempts to renewal of the evil, and
ruins the mechanism of the healthy animal before its hour for ruin, by
natural decay, should be at all near.</p>

<p>It is assumed by most persons that alcohol gives strength, and we hear
feeble persons saying daily that they are being 'kept up by stimulants.'
This means actually that they are being kept down; but the sensation they
derive from the immediate action of the stimulant deceives them and leads
them to attribute passing good to what, in the large majority of cases, is
persistent evil. The evidence is all-perfect that alcohol gives no
potential power to brain or muscle. During the first stage of action it may
enable a wearied or a feeble organism to do brisk work for a short time; it
may make the mind briefly brilliant; it may excite muscle to quick action,
but it does nothing substantially, and fills up nothing it has destroyed,
as it leads to destruction. A fire makes a brilliant sight, but leaves a
desolation. It is the same with alcohol.</p>

<p>On the muscular force the very slightest excess of alcoholic influence
is injurious. I find by measuring the power of muscle for contraction in
the natural state and under alcohol, that so soon as there is a distinct
indication of muscular disturbance, there is also indication of muscular
failure, and if I wished by scientific experiment to spoil for work the
most perfect specimen of a working animal, say a horse, without inflicting
mechanical injury, I could choose no better agent for the purpose of the
experiment than alcohol. But alas! the readiness with which strong,
well-built men slip into general paralysis under the continued influence of
this false support, attests how unnecessary it would be to subject a lower
animal to the experiment. The experiment is a custom, and man is the
subject.</p>

<p>The true place of alcohol is clear; it is an agreeable temporary shroud.
The savage, with the mansions of his soul unfurnished, buries his restless
energy under its shadow. The civilized man overburdened with mental labor,
or with engrossing care, seeks the same shade; but it is shade, after all,
in which, in exact proportion as he seeks it, the seeker retires from
perfect natural <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262"
id="Page_262"></a>[pg 262]</span>life. To search for force in alcohol is,
to my mind, equivalent to the act of seeking for the sun in subterranean
gloom until all is night.</p>

<p>It may be urged that men take alcohol, nevertheless, take it freely, and
yet live; that the adult Swede drinks his average cup of twenty-five
gallons of alcohol per year and remains on the face of the earth. I admit
force even in this argument, for I know under the persistent use of alcohol
there is a limited provision for the continuance of life. In the confirmed
alcoholic the alcohol is, in a certain sense, so disposed of that it fits,
as it were, the body for a long season, nay, becomes part of it; and yet it
is silently doing its fatal work. The organs of the body may be slowly
brought into a state of adaptation to receive it and to dispose of it. But
in that very preparation they are themselves made to undergo physical
changes tending to the destruction of their function, to perversion of
their structure, and to all those varied modifications of organic parts
which the dissector of the human subject learns to recognize,&mdash;almost
without concern, and certainly without anything more than commonplace
curiosity,&mdash;as the devastations incident to alcoholic indulgence."</p>

<p>The statistics collected from the census of the United States for 1860,
and given by Dr. De Marmon, in the <i>New York Medical Journal</i> for
December, 1870, must carry conviction to all minds of the correctness of
the foregoing deductions:</p>

<p>"For the last ten years the use of spirits has, 1. Imposed on the nation
a direct expense of 600,000,000 dollars. 2. Has caused an indirect expense
of 600,000,000 dollars. 3. Has destroyed 300,000 lives. 4. Has sent 100,000
children to the poorhouses. 5. Has committed at least 150,000 people into
prisons and workhouses. 6. Has made at least 1,000 insane. 7. Has
determined at least 2,000 suicides. 8. Has caused the loss by fire or
violence, of at least 10,000,000 dollars' worth of property. 9. Has made
200,000 widows and 1,000 orphans."</p>

<p>If these were the statistics twenty-four years ago, with our greatly
increased population, what must they be to-day? We will let the reader draw
his own conclusions.</p>

<p><b>Malted Liquors</b>. Under this head are included all those liquors
into the composition of which malt enters, such as <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[pg 263]</span>beer, ale, and porter. The
proportion of alcohol in these liquors varies greatly. In beer, it is from
two to five per cent.; in Edinburgh ale, it amounts to six per cent.; in
porter, it is usually from four to six per cent. In addition to alcohol and
water, the malted liquors contain from five to fourteen per cent. of the
extract of malt, and from 0.16 to 0.60 per cent. of carbonic acid. They
possess, according to Pereira, three properties: they quench thirst; they
stimulate, cheer, and, if taken in sufficient quantity, intoxicate; and
they nourish or strengthen. The first of these qualities is due to the
water entering into their composition; the second, to the alcohol; the
third is attributed the nutritive principles of the malt.</p>

<p><b>Objections to their use as Beverages.</b> These articles are either
pure or adulterated. In their pure state the objection to their use for
this purpose lies in the fact that they contain alcohol. This, as we have
seen, is a poisonous substance, which the human system in a state of health
does not need. Its use, when the body is in a normal condition, is uncalled
for, and can only be deleterious. Beverages containing this poison are more
or less deleterious to healthy persons, according to the amount of it which
they contain.</p>

<p>These liquors are frequently adulterated, and this increases their
injurious effects. The ingenuity of man has been taxed to increase their
intoxicating properties; to heighten the color and flavor, to create
pungency and thirst; and to revive old beer. To increase the intoxicating
power, tobacco or the seeds of the Cocculus indicus are added; to heighten
the color and flavor, burnt sugar, liquorice, or treacle, quassia, or
strychnine, coriander, and caraway seeds are employed; to increase the
pungency, cayenne pepper or common salt is added; to revive old beer, or
ale, it is shaken up with green vitriol or sulphate of iron, or with alum
and common salt.</p>

<p><b>Fermented Liquors.</b> These are cider and wine. Cider contains
alcohol to the amount of from five to ten per cent., saccharine matter,
lactic acid, and other substances. New cider may be drunk in large
quantities without inducing intoxication, but old cider is quite as
intoxicating as ale or porter.</p>

<p>The composition of wine is very complex, the peculiar qualities which
characterize the different varieties cannot be <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>[pg 264]</span>ascertained by chemical
analysis. Wine is a solution of alcohol in water, combined with various
constituents of the grape. The amount of alcohol in wines ranges from six
to forty per cent. As beverages, these are open to the same objections as
those manufactured from malt. As a medicine, wine is a useful remedy.
Concerning its use in this capacity, Prof. Liebig says: "Wine is a
restorative. As a means of refreshment when the powers of life are
exhausted&mdash;as a means of compensation where a misappropriation occurs in
nutrition, and as a means of protection against transient organic
disturbances, it is surpassed by no product of nature or art." That an
article is useful in medicine, however, is no reason why it should be used
as a beverage by those in health. It is rather an argument against such a
practice. For it is generally true that the drugs used to restore the
diseased system to health, are pernicious or poisonous to it when in a
normal condition.</p>

<p><b>Distilled Liquors.</b> These are whiskey, brandy, and the kindred
productions of the still. Whiskey is a solution of alcohol in water, mixed
with various other principles which impart to it peculiar physical
properties. The amount of alcohol which it contains varies from forty-eight
to fifty-six per cent. Old whiskey is more highly prized than the more
recent product of the still, from the fact that when kept for some years
certain volatile oils are generated which, impart to it a mellowness of
flavor.</p>

<p>Brandy is a solution of alcohol in water, together with various other
substances. It contains from fifty to fifty-six per cent. of alcohol. Pure
brandy is distilled from wine, 1,000 gallons of wine yielding from 100 to
150 gallons of brandy, but a very large proportion of the brandy is made
with little or no wine. It is made artificially from high wines by the
addition of oil of Cognac, to give it flavor, burnt sugar to give it color,
and logwood or catechu, to impart astringency and roughness of taste. The
best brandy is obtained by distillation from the best quality of white
wines, from the districts of Cognac and Armagnac in France.</p>


<h4>THE CLOTHING.</h4>


<p>There is no physical agent which exerts a more constant or more powerful
influence upon health and life, than the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[pg 265]</span>atmosphere. The climate in
these latitudes is exceedingly variable, ranging all the way from 110&deg;
Fahr. in summer to 40&deg; below zero in the winter season. The body of
every individual should be so protected from cold, that it can maintain a
mean temperature of 98&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>When the body is warm there is a free and equal circulation of the blood
throughout all the structures. When the surface is subjected to cold, the
numerous capillaries and minute vessels carrying the blood, contract and
diminish in size, increasing the amount of this fluid in the internal
organs, thus causing congestion. The blood must go somewhere, and if driven
from the surface, it retreats to the cavities within. Hence this repletion
of the vital organs causes pain from pressure and fullness of the distended
blood-vessels, and the organic functions are embarrassed. Besides, cold
upon the surface shuts up the pores of the skin, which are among the most
active and important excretory ducts of the system. It is evident, then,
that we require suitable clothing, not only for comfort, but to maintain
the temperature and functions essential to health and life.</p>

<p>The chief object to be attained by dress is the maintenance of a uniform
temperature of the body. To attain this end, it is necessary that the
exhalations of the system, which are continually escaping through the pores
of the skin, should be absorbed or conducted away from the person. These
exudations occur in the form of sensible or insensible perspiration, and
the clothing, to be healthy, should be so porous as to allow them freely to
escape into the air.</p>

<p>A substance should also be chosen which is known to be a poor conductor
of heat. That generated by the system will thus be retained where it is
needed, instead of being dispersed into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>We might add that the better the material for accomplishing these
purposes, the less will be needed to be worn; for we do not wish to wear or
carry about with us any more material than is necessary. It so happens that
all of these qualities are found combined in <i>flannel</i>. The value of
this article worn next to the skin cannot be over-rated, for while it
affords protection from cold during the winter months, it is equally
beneficial during the heat of summer, because it imbibes the perspiration,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[pg
266]</span>and being very porous, allows it to escape. The skin always
feels soft, smooth, and pliable, when it is worn; but, when cotton takes
its place, it soon becomes dry and harsh. Its natural adaptability to these
purposes, shows that it is equally a comfort and a source of health. Where
the skin is very delicate, flannel sometimes causes irritation. In such
cases a thin fabric of linen, cotton, or silk, should be worn next the
skin, with flannel immediately over it. Where there is a uniform and
extreme degree of heat, cotton and linen are very conducive to comfort. But
they are unsuitable in a climate or season liable to sudden fluctuations in
temperature.</p>

<p>The value of furs, where people are exposed to extreme cold, cannot be
overestimated. They are much warmer than wool, and are chiefly used as
wraps on going outdoors. They are too cumbrous and expensive for ordinary
wear in this latitude, but in places near the poles they constitute the
chief clothing of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The quantity of clothing worn is another important item. The least that
is necessary to keep the body well protected and evenly tempered when
employed is the rule of health. Some people, instead of wearing flannels
next to the body, put on other material in greater abundance, thus
confining the perspiration to the skin and making the body chilly. The
amount of clothing is then increased, until they are so heavily clad that
they cannot exercise. It is far better to wear one thickness of flannel
next to the skin, and then cotton, or woolen, for outside garments, and be
able to exercise, thus allowing the blood to circulate and to assist in the
warming process.</p>

<p>One great fault in dress consists in neglecting to properly clothe the
upper extremities. Some people do not reflect upon the necessity, while
others are too proud to be directed by plain common sense. In the winter
season, the feet should be covered with woolen stockings. The next matter
of importance, is to get a thick, broad-soled shoe, so large that it will
not prevent the free circulation of the blood. Then for walking, and
especially for riding, when the earth is wet and cold, or when there is
snow on the ground, wear a flannel-lined rubber or "Arctic" over-shoe.
<i>Be sure and keep the feet comfortable and warm at all times.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[pg
267]</span>Our next advice is to keep the legs warm. We were called not
long ago, to see a young lady who had contracted a severe cold. She had
been to an entertainment where the apartments were nicely warmed, and from
thence had walked home late in the evening. We inquired into the
circumstances of the case, and ascertained that she wore flannel about her
chest, and that she also wore rubbers over her shoes, but the other
portions of the lower extremities were protected by cotton coverings. In
short, her legs were not kept warm, and she took cold by going out from
warm rooms into a chilly atmosphere. A good pair of woolen leggings might
have saved her much suffering. The results of insufficient protection of
the lower extremities are colds, coughs, consumption, headaches, pain in
the side, menstrual derangements, uterine congestion and disorders, besides
disablement for the ordinary and necessary duties of life. All these may be
prevented by clothing the legs suitably, and wearing comfortable
flannels.</p>

<p>Young people can bear a low temperature of the body better than old
people, because they possess greater power of endurance. But that is no
reason for unnecessary exposure.</p>

<p>The amount of clothing should be regulated according to the
heat-generating power of the individual, and also according to the
susceptibility to cold. No two persons are exactly alike in these respects.
But it is never proper for young people to reject the counsels of
experience, or treat lightly the advice to protect themselves thoroughly
against the cold. Many a parent's heart has ached as he has followed the
mortal remains of a darling child to the grave, knowing that if good advice
had been heeded, in all human probability, the life would have been
prolonged.</p>

<p>The most deleterious mechanical errors in clothing are those which
affect the chest and body. Tight lacing still plays too important a part in
dress. It interferes with the free and healthy movements of the body, and
effects a pressure which is alike injurious to the organs of respiration,
circulation, and digestion. The great muscle of respiration, the diaphragm,
is impeded in its motion, and is, therefore, unable to act freely. The
large blood-vessels are compressed, and when the pressure is excessive the
heart and lungs are also subjected to restraint <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[pg 268]</span>and thrown out of their
proper positions. From the compression of the liver and stomach, the
functions of digestion are impeded, a distaste for solid food, flatulency
and pain after eating are the unmistakable proofs of the injury which is
being inflicted.</p>

<p>The evil effects of such pressure are not confined to actual periods of
time during which this pressure is applied. They continue after it has been
removed and when the chest and trunk of the body have thus been subjected
to long-continued pressure they become permanently deformed. These
deformities necessarily entail great suffering in child-bearing.</p>

<p>The evil effects of mechanical pressure on other parts of the body are
not uncommon. The leg is sometimes so indented by a tight garter that the
returning flow of blood through the veins is prevented, and a varicose
condition of these vessels is produced.</p>

<p>Irregular and excessive pressure on the foot by imperfectly fitting
shoes or boots produce deformities of the feet and cause much suffering.
The high heels which are so common on the shoes of women and children
inflict more than a local injury. Every time the body comes down upon the
raised heel with its full weight a slight shock or vibration is
communicated throughout the entire extent of the spinal column, and the
nervous mechanism is thereby injured. Furthermore, displacements of the
pelvic organs frequently result from these unnatural and absurd articles of
dress. Women of fashion are subjected to much annoyance from wearing long,
flowing skirts suspended from their waists to trail uselessly on the floor
and gather dust. It is impossible for the wearers of these ridiculous
garments to exercise their limbs properly or to breathe naturally.
Indigestion, palpitation, shortness of breath, and physical degeneracy are
the inevitable consequences of their folly. The skirts should always be
suspended from the shoulders and not from the hips. It is especially
important that the clothing of children should not fit too tightly.</p>

<p>It is very important that the clothing should be kept clean. That which
is worn for a long time becomes saturated with the excretions and
exhalations of the body, which prevent free transpiration from the pores of
the skin, and thereby induce mental inactivity and depression of the
physical powers. Unclear clothing may be the means of conveying disease.
Scarlet <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[pg
269]</span>fever has been conveyed frequently by the clothing of a nurse
into a healthy family. All of the contagious diseases have been
communicated by clothing contaminated in laundries.</p>

<p>Certain dyes which are largely used in the coloring of wearing apparel
are poisonous, and give rise to local disease of the skin, accompanied in
some instances, with constitutional symptoms. The principal poisonous dyes
are the red and yellow aniline. A case of poisoning from wearing stockings
colored with aniline dyes, in which there were severe constitutional
symptoms, came under our observation at the Invalids' Hotel recently.</p>

<h1>PHYSICAL EXERCISE. MENTAL CULTURE. SLEEP. CLEANLINESS.</h1>


<p>A well-developed physical organization is essential to perfect health.
Among the Greeks, beauty ranked next to virtue, and an eminent author has
said that "the nearer we approach Divinity, the more we reflect His eternal
beauty." The perfect expression of thought requires the physical
accompaniments of language, gesture, etc. The human form is pliable, and,
with proper culture, can be made replete with expression, grace and beauty.
The cultivation of the intellectual powers has been allowed to supplant
physical training to a great extent. The results are abnormally developed
brains, delicate forms, sensitive nerves and shortened lives. That the
physical and mental systems should be collaterally developed, is a fact
generally overlooked by educators. The fullness of a great intellect is
generally impaired when united with a weak and frail body. We have sought
perfection in animals and plants. To the former we have given all the
degree of strength and grace requisite to their peculiar duties; to the
latter we have imparted all the delicate tints and shadings that fancy
could picture. We have studied the laws of their existence, until we are
familiar with every phase of their production; yet it remains for man to
learn those laws of his own being, by a knowledge of which he may promote
and preserve the beauty of the human form, and thus render it, indeed, an
image of its <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[pg
271]</span>Maker. When the body is tenanted by a cultivated intellect, the
result is a unity which is unique, commanding the respect of humanity, and
insuring a successful life to the possessor. Students are as a rule pale
and emaciated. Mental application is generally the cause assigned when, in
reality, it is the result of insufficient exercise, impure air, and
dietetic errors. An intelligent journalist has remarked that "many of our
ministers weigh too little in the pulpit, because they weigh too little on
the scales." The Greek Gymnasium and Olympian Games were the sure
foundations of that education from which arose that subtle philosophy,
poetry, and military skill which have won the admiration of nineteen
centuries. The laurel crown of the Olympian victor was far more precious to
the Grecian youth than the gilded prize is to our modern genius. A popular
lecturer has truly remarked, that "we make brilliant mathematicians and
miserable dyspeptics; fine linguists with bronchial throats; good writers
with narrow chests and pale complexions; smart scholars, but not that
union, which the ancients prized, of a sound mind in a sound body. The
brain becomes the chief working muscle of the system. We refine and
re-refine the intellectual powers down to a diamond point and brilliancy,
as if they were the sole or reigning faculties, and we had not a physical
nature binding us to earth, and a spiritual nature binding us to the great
heavens and the greater God who inhabits them. Thus the university becomes
a sort of splendid hospital with this difference, that the hospital
<i>cures</i>, while the university <i>creates</i> disease. Most of them are
indicted at the bar of public opinion for taking the finest young brain and
blood of the country, and, after working upon them for four years,
returning them to their homes skilled indeed to perform certain linguistic
and mathematical dexterities, but very much below par in health and
endurance, and, in short, seriously damaged and physically demoralized." We
read with reverence the sublime teachings of Aristotle and Plato; we mark
the grandeur of Homer and the delicate beauties of Virgil; but we do not
seek to reproduce in our modern institutions the gymnasium, which was the
real foundation of their genius. Colleges which are now entering upon their
career, should make ample provision for those exercises <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>[pg 272]</span>which
develop the <i>physical man.</i> This lack of bodily training is common
with all classes, and its effects are written in indelible characters on
the faces and forms of old and young. Constrained positions in sitting
restrict the movements of the diaphragm and ribs and often cause diseases
of the spine, or unnatural curvatures, which prove disastrous to health and
happiness. The head should be held erect and the shoulders thrown backward,
so that at each inspiration the lungs may be fully expanded.</p>

<p>Physical exercise should never be too violent or too prolonged. Severe
physical labor, and athletic sports, if indulged in to an extreme degree,
produce undue excitability of the heart, and sometimes cause it to become
enlarged. There is a form of heart disease induced by undue exertion which
may be called a wearing out or wasting away of that organ. It is common in
those persons whose occupations expose them to excessive physical labor for
too many hours together. This feebleness of heart is felt but little by
vigorous persons under forty years of age, but in those who have passed
this age it becomes manifest. However, when any person so affected is
attacked by any acute disease, the heart is more liable to fail, and thus
cause a fatal termination.</p>

<p>Aneurism of the aorta or the large arteries branching off from it, which
is a dilatation of the walls of these vessels, caused by the rupture of one
or two of their coats, is generally induced by excessive physical strain,
such as lifting heavy weights, or carrying weights up long flights of
stairs, violent horseback exercise, or hurrying to catch a train or street
car.</p>

<p><b>An Erect Carriage</b> is not only essential to health, but adds grace
and beauty to every movement. Although man was made to stand erect, thus
indicating his superiority over all other animals, yet custom has done much
to curve that magnificent central column, upon the summit of which rests
the "grand dome of thought." Many young persons unconsciously acquire the
habit of throwing the shoulders forward. The spinal column is weakened by
this unnatural posture, its vertebr&aelig; become so sensitive and
distorted that they cannot easily support the weight of the body or sustain
its equilibrium. It is generally believed that persons of sedentary habits
are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[pg
273]</span>more liable to become round-shouldered than any other class of
individuals. Observation shows, on the contrary, that the manual laborer,
or even the idler, often acquires this stooping posture. It can be
remedied, not by artificial braces, but by habitually throwing the
shoulders backwards. Deformed trunks and crooked spines, although sometimes
the effects of disease are more frequently the results of carelessness.
Jacques has remarked that "one's standing among his fellow-men is quite as
important a matter in a <i>physiological</i>, as in a <i>social</i> sense."
<i>Walking</i> is one of the most efficient means of physical culture, as
it calls all the muscles into action and produces the amount of tension
requisite for their tonicity. Long walks or protracted physical exercise of
any kind should never be undertaken immediately after meals. The first
essential to a healthful walk is a pleasurable object. Beautiful scenery,
rambles in meadows rich with fragrant grasses, or along the flowery banks
of water-courses, affords an agreeable stimulus, which sends the blood
through the vital channels with unwonted force, and imparts to the cheeks
the ruddy glow of health. Our poets acknowledge the silent influence of
nature. Wordsworth has expressed this thought in his own sublime way:</p>

<blockquote>
"The floating clouds their state shall lend<br />
To her: for her the willow bend;<br />
Nor shall she fail to see,<br />
E'en in the motions of the storm<br />
Grace that shall mould the maiden's form<br />
By silent sympathy.<br />
The stars of midnight shall be dear<br />
To her: and she shall lean her ear<br />
In many a secret place,<br />
Where rivulets dance their wayward round,<br />
And beauty, born of murmuring sound,<br />
Shall pass into her face."<br />
</blockquote>

<p><b>Base Ball, Cricket, Boxing, and Fencing</b>, are all manly exercises
when practiced solely with a view to their hygienic advantages and as such
have our approval.</p>

<p><b>The Art of Swimming</b> was regarded by the Greeks as an important
accomplishment. As a hygienic agency, it occupies a high place in physical
culture. The varied movements impart strength and elasticity to the
muscles. It is as charming a recreation for women and girls as for men and
boys. Furthermore, it is not only a means of physical culture, but is often
essential for self-preservation.</p>

<p><b>The Exercises of the Gymnasium</b> are especially productive of
health and longevity. The most important of these are balancing, leaping,
climbing, wrestling, and throwing, all of which are especially adapted to
the development of the muscles. In conclusion, we offer the following
suggestions, viz: all gymnastic exercises should be practiced in the
morning, and in the open air; extremes should be avoided; and it should be
always borne in mind, that their chief object is to combine, in a proper
proportion, mental and physical development. In every relation of life we
should cultivate all those faculties which pertain to our physical, moral,
and mental natures, subdue our passions, and nature will bestow upon us her
richest rewards of health, beauty, and happiness.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[pg
275]</span><h4>CYCLING.</h4>




<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise093"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
" src="images/advise093.png" /></a><br /></p>

<p>If one were asked what athletic exercise deserves to be the most popular
in America to-day, the answer would of necessity be cycling. The bicycle is
being used by people of all ages and conditions of health in daily life;
its hygienic value as a means to healthy exercise cannot be overestimated.
In this, as in everything else, immoderation is to be condemned,
particularly where persons have not had sufficient training to take long
"spins," or attempt racing. Beginners should ride only 10 or 12 minutes at
a time&mdash;resting then to permit the circulation to become equalized. In all
cyclists, at all ages, in veteran riders as well as those not practiced in
the art, there is, in the beginning of each attempt, a quickened
circulation; the pulse is full and bounding, and rarely falls under a
hundred pulsations per minute. So long as the exercise is continued, an
increase of cardiac motion is observable, and a vigorous circulation is
kept up. This accounts for the astounding journeys a fully trained cyclist
can accomplish, and also for his endurance without sleep. In spite of the
quickened motion of the heart, rarely have riders been known to grow giddy
or show symptoms of cardiac embarrassment. A good rider may climb a hill
without trouble, yet be unable to climb a flight of stairs without
breathlessness and palpitation. Bicycle riding as a means for acquiring
strength and vigor, improving the circulation and developing the
respiratory organs, is unexcelled. Fast riding, or "scorching," among those
not used to physical exertion, and leaning over the handle-bars so as to
ride in a stooping position, are to be heartily condemned. The latter
prevents the lungs from getting their full expansion, and cultivates a
tendency to round shoulders. Men or women suffering from diseases of the
sexual organs should, before riding, consult the physician having their
case in charge.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise094"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 112." src="images/advise094.png" /></a><br />Fig. 112.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[pg
276]</span><b>Riding on Horseback</b> is a fine exercise for both sexes. It
promotes digestion, improves the circulation, and expands and develops the
respiratory organs. The pure, fresh air, pleasant scenery, and pleasurable
excitement, impart renewed vigor to the equestrian. In the Southern States
it is a universal accomplishment, and children are taught to ride as well
as to walk.</p>

<p><b>Dancing</b>. Notwithstanding the fact that dancing has been perverted
to the basest purposes, has been made the fruitful source of dissipation,
and has often laid the foundation for disease, it is yet capable of being
made to minister to health and happiness. As a means of physical culture,
it favors the development of the muscular system, and promotes health and
cheerfulness. When practiced for this purpose, Jacques terms it "the best
of all indoor exercises," as it brings to bear upon the physical system a
great number of energizing and harmonious influences.</p>


<h4>MENTAL CULTURE.</h4>


<p>The brain, like all other organs of the body, requires alternate
exercise and repose; and, in physical endurance, it is subject to general
physiological laws. When exercised with moderation it acquires strength,
vigor, and an accelerated activity. Excessive mental exertion is liable to
result in softening of the brain, and various nervous diseases, sometimes
culminating in insanity, and in many instances proving fatal to life. The
mere votaries of pleasure who avoid all effort of the mind, fall into the
opposite error. In all cases of intellectual activity, the exertions should
be directed to some subject interesting to the student. In this manner duty
will become a pleasure, which in turn will re-invigorate the mental
functions.</p>

<p>When the mind in confined to one subject for any considerable length of
time together, it becomes fatigued, and requires relaxation, recreation,
rest. This may be obtained by directing the attention to some other
subject, either study or amusement, the latter of which is preferable. The
amusement, however, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277"
id="Page_277"></a>[pg 277]</span>may be of an intellectual or physical
character or both combined, and will, if properly conducted, restore vigor
to both mind and body.</p>

<p>Prominent among physical phenomena is the mutual relation between the
brain and the organs of nutrition. Mental exertion should be avoided for at
least one hour after a hearty meal, and all mental labor which requires
concentration of thought ought to be accomplished in the earlier portion of
the day, when the brain is refreshed and repaired by the night's repose.
Mental, like physical endurance, is modified by age, health and
development. A person accustomed to concentration of thought, can endure a
longer mental strain than one inured to manual labor only. One of the most
injurious customs, is the cultivation of the intellect at the expense of
the physical powers.</p>

<p><b>Mental Culture During Childhood.</b> One of the greatest mistakes
which people make in the management of their children, is to overtask their
mental faculties. Although it is exceedingly gratifying to see children
acquire knowledge, and manifest an understanding far beyond their years,
this gratification is often purchased too dearly, for precocious children
are apt to die young. The tissue of the brain and nerves of children is
very delicate; they have not yet acquired the powers of endurance which
older persons possess. The greater portion of the nutriment assimilated, is
required for growth and organic development, and they can ill afford its
expenditure for mental manifestations. They receive impressions easier and
learn much more readily than in after life, but it is at the expense of the
physical organization. Their mental faculties continue to be developed by
the expenditure of brain nutriment, while physical growth and the powers of
endurance are arrested. It is much better to give physical development the
precedence in order that the mental organism may be well supported and its
operations carried into effect; for it must be apparent to all that an
ordinary intellect in a healthy body, is capable of accomplishing
infinitely more than a strong mind in a <i>weak</i> body. Regularity should
be observed in exercising the mental functions. For this reason a fixed
order in the pursuit of any literary occupation is very essential. The
pursuit of the most abstruse studies will thus become habitual and
comparatively <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278"
id="Page_278"></a>[pg 278]</span>easy, a consequence of systematic
application. Mental labor should always cease when the train of thought
becomes confused, and there is the slightest sensation of depression. All
distracting influences should be absent from the mind, in order to
facilitate intense study, for the intellect cannot attend perfectly to two
subjects at the same time. Painful sensations always have a tendency to
paralyze mental exertion. Great care should be taken that the head is not
subjected to injury of any kind, as it is almost invariably accompanied by
some nervous derangement. Exposure to extreme heat should be carefully
avoided. An attack of sun-stroke although it may not be immediately fatal,
may occasion tumors in the brain, or some organic disease.</p>


<h4>SLEEP.</h4>


<p>For all animated beings sleep is an imperious necessity, as
indispensable as food. The welfare of man requires alternate periods of
activity and repose. It is a well-established physiological fact, that
during the wakeful hours the vital energies are being expended, the powers
of life diminished, and, if wakefulness is continued beyond a certain
limit, the system becomes enfeebled and death is the result. During sleep
there is a temporary cessation of vital expenditures, and a recuperation of
all the forces. Under the influence of sleep "the blood is refreshed, the
brain recruited, physical sufferings are extinguished, mental troubles are
removed, the organism is relieved, and hope returns to the heart."</p>

<p>The severest punishment which can be inflicted upon a person, is to
entirely deprive him of sleep. In China, a few years since, three criminals
were sentenced to be kept awake until they should die. To do this it was
necessary to keep a guard over them. The sentinels were armed with sharp,
pointed instruments, with which to goad the victims and thus prevent them
from sleeping. Life soon became a burden, and, although they were well fed
during the time, death occurred sooner than it would have done had
starvation been the punishment.</p>

<p><b>Sleeping Rooms.</b> The sleeping room should be large and well
ventilated, and the air kept moderately cool. The necessity for a fire may
be determined by the health of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279"
id="Page_279"></a>[pg 279]</span>occupant. Besides maintaining a proper
temperature in the room, a little fire is useful, especially if in a grate,
for the purpose of securing good ventilation. The windows should not be so
arranged as to allow a draught upon the body during the night, but yet so
adjusted that the inmate may obtain plenty of fresh air.</p>

<p><b>The Bed</b> should not be too soft, but rather hard. Feathers give
off animal emanations of an injurious character, and impart a feeling of
lassitude and debility to those sleeping on them. No more coverings should
be used than are actually necessary for the comfort of the individual.
Cotton sheets are warmer than linen, and answer equally as well.</p>

<p><b>Sleeping Alone.</b> Certain effluvia are thrown off from our persons,
and when two individuals sleep together each inhales from the other more or
less of these emanations. There is little doubt that <i>consumption</i>,
and many other diseases, not usually considered contagious, are sometimes
communicated in this manner. When it is not practicable for individuals to
occupy separate beds, the persons sleeping together should be of about the
same age, and in good health. Numerous cases have occurred in which
healthy, robust children have gradually declined and died within a few
months, from the evil effects of sleeping with old people. Again, those in
feeble health have been greatly benefited, and even restored, by sleeping
with others who were young and healthy.</p>

<p><b>Time for Sleep.</b> <i>Night</i> is the proper time for sleep. When
day is substituted for night, the sleep obtained does not fully restore the
exhausted energies of the system. Nature does not allow her laws to be
broken with impunity.</p>

<p>Children require more sleep than old persons. They are sometimes
stupefied with "soothing syrups," and preparations of opium, in order to
get them temporarily out of the way. Such narcotics are very injurious and
dangerous. We have known a young child to be killed by a <i>single drop</i>
of laudanum. This practice, therefore, cannot be too emphatically
condemned.</p>

<p><b>How to Put Children to Bed.</b> The following characteristic lines
are from the pen of Fanny Fern, and contain such good advice that we cannot
refrain from quoting them: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280"
id="Page_280"></a>[pg 280]</span>"Not with a reproof for any of the day's
sins of omission or commission. Take any other time than bed-time for that.
If you ever heard a little creature sighing or sobbing in its sleep, you
could never do this. Seal their closing eyelids with a kiss and a blessing.
The time will come, all too soon, when they will lay their heads upon their
pillows lacking both. Let them at least have this sweet memory of happy
childhood, of which no future sorrow or trouble can rob them. Give them
their rosy youth. Nor need this involve wild license. The judicious parent
will not so mistake my meaning. If you ever met the man or the woman, whose
eyes have suddenly filled when a little child has crept trustingly to its
mother's breast, you may have seen one in whose childhood's home 'dignity'
and 'severity' stood where love and pity should have been. Too much
indulgence has ruined thousands of children; too much love not one."</p>

<p><b>Position in Sleep.</b> The proper position in sleep is upon the right
side. The orifice leading from the stomach to the bowels being on this
side, this position favors the passage of the contents into the duodenum.
Lying on the back is injurious, since by so doing the spine becomes heated,
especially if the person sleeps on feathers, the circulation is obstructed
and local congestions are encouraged. The face should never be covered
during sleep, since it necessitates the breathing of the same air over
again, together with the emanations from the body.</p>

<p><b>The Amount of Sleep.</b> The amount of sleep required varies with the
age, habits, condition, and peculiarities of the individual. No definite
rule can be given for the guidance of all. The average amount required,
however, is eight or nine hours out of the twenty-four. Some persons need
more than this, while others can do with less. Since both body and mind are
recuperated by sleep, the more they are exhausted the more sleep is
required. A person employed at mental labor should have more than one who
is merely expending muscular strength. Six hours of unbroken sleep do more
to refresh and revive than ten when frequently interrupted. If it is too
prolonged it weakens and stupefies both body and mind. If an insufficient
amount is taken the flagging energies are not <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>[pg 281]</span>restored. Persons who eat
much, or use stimulants generally require more than others. To sleep
regularity is desirable. If a person goes to bed at a certain hour for
several nights in succession, it will soon become a habit. The same holds
true with regard to rising. If children are put to sleep at a stated hour
for several days in succession, it will soon become a habit with them.</p>


<h4>CLEANLINESS.</h4>


<p>"Cleanliness is next to godliness," and is essential to the health and
vigor of the system. Its importance cannot be overestimated, and it should
be inculcated early on the minds of the young. "Even from the body's
purity, the mind receives a secret sympathetic aid."</p>

<p>When we consider the functions of the skin, with its myriads of minute
glands, innumerable little tubes, employed in removing the worn-out,
useless matter from the system, we cannot fail to appreciate the utility of
frequent bathing with soap and water. Unless these excretions are removed,
the glands become obstructed, their functions are arrested, and unpleasant
odors arise. Many persons think because they daily bathe the face, neck,
and hands, dress the hair becomingly and remove the dirt from their
clothing that the height of cleanliness has been reached. From a hygienic
point of view, bathing the <i>entire</i> body is of much greater
importance.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the necessity for cleanliness of the body, we
occasionally meet with persons who, although particular about their
personal appearance, permit their bodies to be for weeks and even months
without a bath. Such neglect should never exceed one week. Plenty of
sunlight and at least one or two general baths every week are essential to
perfect health. Cleanliness is necessary to health, beauty, attractiveness,
and a cheerful disposition.</p>

<h2><a name='IICHAPTER_IV'></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h1>HYGIENE OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS.</h1>


<p>The structure and functions of organized bodies are subject to continual
alteration. The changes of nutrition and growth, which are constantly
taking place in the tissues render them at the same time the seat of repair
and waste, of renovation and decomposition, of life and death. The plant
germinates and blossoms, then withers and decays; animal life, in like
manner, comes into being, grows to maturity, fades, and dies. It is,
therefore, essential to the perpetuation of life, that new organisms be
provided to take the place of those which are passing out of existence.
There is no physiological process which presents more interesting phenomena
than that of reproduction, which includes the formation, as well as the
development of new beings.</p>

<p>Since self-preservation is Nature's first law, the desire for food is a
most powerful instinct in all living animals. Not inferior to this law is
that for the perpetuation of the race; and for this purpose, throughout the
animal and vegetable kingdoms, we find the Biblical statement literally
illustrated: "Male and female created He them."</p>

<p>Health is the gauge by which the prosperity of a people may be measured.
Were we to trace the history of nations,&mdash;their rise and fall,&mdash;we would
find that much of the barbarism and crime, degradation and vice, as well as
their decline and final extinction, was due to licentiousness and sexual
excesses. Since there is an intimate relation between mind and body, when
the body is enfeebled the mind becomes enervated. Morbid <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>[pg
283]</span>conditions of the body prevent the highest mental development,
and, on the other hand, when the mind is debilitated, general depravity,
physical as well as mental, is the result. The highest development of the
body results from the equal and harmonious cultivation of all the mental
powers. The perfect development and health of the physical organs is
therefore essential to the happiness of mankind. But, before health can be
insured the nature and general functions of the physical system must be
understood. This being done, the question naturally arises: <i>How can
health be best maintained and longevity secured?</i></p>

<p><b>Influence of Food.</b> We have previously noticed the effects which
food, exercise, and other hygienic agencies, have upon digestion,
circulation, and respiration; and we find that they exert a not less potent
influence upon the health of the generative organs. Excessive stimulation
excites the sexual passions. For this reason, children should not be
immoderately indulged in highly seasoned foods. Those persons who have
great muscular vigor are endowed with violent passions, and unless
restrained by moral considerations, are very likely to be overcome by their
animal propensities.</p>

<p><i>Alcoholic stimulants</i> have a debasing influence upon the whole
system, and especially upon the sexual organs; they excite the animal and
debase the moral nature; they exhaust the vitality, and, after the
excitement, which they temporarily induce, has passed away, the body is
left in a prostrated condition.</p>

<p><b>Physical Labor modifies the Passions.</b> Labor consumes the surplus
vitality which a person may possess, and no better protective can be found
against the gratification of the passions, unless it be high moral
training, than daily toil extended to such a degree as to produce fatigue.
Labor determines the blood to the surface and to other parts of the body,
and prevents excitement and congestion of the sexual centers. If, by
education or association, the passions of children be excited, they will be
increased. If, on the contrary, they be taught to avoid these social or
solitary evils, they will be abated. Let them be educated to work and the
intellectual faculties will assert their sway, the moral powers will be
strengthened, and the body better developed, for purity of mind is the
result of the perfect development of man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[pg
284]</span><b>Influences Of Climate.</b> Individuals possess distinguishing
peculiarities characteristic of the nation to which they belong. Climate
exerts a powerful influence upon mankind. In tropical regions the
inhabitants are enervated, effeminate, and sensual. The rich live in luxury
and ease, vice is unrestrained and license unbridled. When the animal
propensities are allowed to predominate, the mental faculties are kept in
subjection. Hence races that inhabit those latitudes rarely produce
scholars or philosophers. A warm climate hastens the development of the
reproductive organs. Men and women become mature at a much earlier age in
those regions, than in countries where the temperature is lower. In like
manner there is a tendency to premature enfeeblement, for the earlier the
system matures, the sooner it deteriorates.</p>

<p><b>Man is a Social Being.</b> History demonstrates that when man is
deprived of the society of women, he becomes reckless, vicious, depraved,
and even barbarous in his habits, thus illustrating the maxim: "It is not
good for man to be alone." Social intercourse promotes mental and physical
development. The development of the individual implies the unfolding of
every power, both physical and mental. Nothing so regulates and restrains
passion as a healthy condition of the organs through which it finds
expression. And every organ of the body is powerful in proportion to its
soundness. The propensities play a prominent part in the education of the
child. When properly disciplined and held in subordination to the higher
faculties, they constitute an important factor in the economy of man. Boys
are more liable to be morbidly excited when secluded from the society of
girls, and vice versa. Again, when the sexes are accustomed to associate,
the passions are not apt to be aroused, because of the natural antagonistic
constitutional elements. The influence of the one refines, and ennobles the
other. Let children be taught to understand their natures, and knowing
them, they will learn self-government. "As man rises in education and moral
feeling he proportionately rises in the power of self-restraint; and
consequently as he becomes deprived of this wholesome law of discipline he
sinks into self-indulgence and the brutality of savage life.</p>

<p>The passions may be aroused by the language, appearance <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>[pg 285]</span>or
dress of the opposite sex. A word spoken without any impure intent is often
construed in a very different sense by one whose passions color the
thought, and is made to convey an impression entirely unlike that which was
intended by the speaker. Also, the dress may be of such a character as to
excite the sexual passion. The manner in which the apparel is worn is often
so conspicuous as to become bawdy, thereby appealing to the libidinous
desires, rather than awakening an admiration for the mental qualities.</p>

<p><b>Obscene Literature.</b> Literature is a powerful agent either for
good or evil. If we would improve the morals, <i>choice</i> literature must
be selected, whether it be that which realizes the ideal, or idealizes the
real. Obscene literature, or books written for the express purpose of
exciting or intensifying sexual desires in the young, goads to an illicit
gratification of the passions, and ruins the moral and physical nature.</p>

<p>It not unfrequently happens that a child is born with a vigorous, mental
organism which promises a brilliant future, but manhood finds him
incompetent, debilitated, and totally incapacitated for mental or manual
labor. This may be the result of youthful indiscretion, ignorantly
committed, but not unfrequently it is the effect of a pernicious literature
which inflames the imagination, tramples upon reason, and describes to the
youth a realm where the passions are the ruling deities.</p>

<p>Many persons are born into the world with disordered organizations for
which they are not themselves responsible. Such individuals are entitled to
the sympathy of humanity. Dyspepsia, scrofula, consumption, and a thousand
ills to which mankind is heir, are inherited from parents, the results of
ill-assorted marriages. Intoxicated parents often produce offspring utterly
demented. Children of healthy parents, with good constitutions, are usually
healthy and intelligent. There are marked varieties of character in
children of the same parents. One manifests great precocity, another is
below the average in mental attainments; one is amiable, another irritable
in disposition; indeed, there are often as great differences between
children of the same, as of different families. This is due to the physical
and mental conditions of the parents, more especially the mother, not only
at the time of the impregnation <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286"
id="Page_286"></a>[pg 286]</span>but also during the period intervening
between conception and the birth of the offspring. The ancients regarded
courage as the principal virtue. By us, purity is so estimated. Moral
purity is an essential requisite to the growth and perfection of the
character.</p>

<p><b>Self-Abuse.</b> Untold miseries arise from the pollution of the body.
Self-pollution, or onanism, is one of the most prolific sources of evil,
since it leads both to the degradation of body and mind. It is practiced
more or less by members of both sexes, and the habit once established, is
overcome with the greatest difficulty. It is the source of numerous
diseases which derange the functional activity of the organs involved, and
eventually impair the constitution. This vicious habit is often practiced
by those who are ignorant of its dangerous results. Statistics show that
insanity is frequently caused by masturbation.</p>

<p>Immoderate indulgence in any practice is deleterious to the individual.
Emphatically true is this with regard to sexual excesses. Not unfrequently
does the marriage rite "cover a multitude of sins." The abuse of the
conjugal relation produces the most serious results to both parties, and is
a prolific source of some of the gravest forms of disease. Prostatorrhea,
spermatorrhea, impotency, hypochondria, and general debility of the
generative organs, arise from sexual excesses.</p>

<p>The health of the reproductive organs can only be maintained by leading
a <i>temperate</i> life. The food should be nourishing but not stimulating.
Lascivious thoughts should be banished from the mind, and a taste
cultivated for that literature which is elevating in its nature, and the
associations should be refining and ennobling. Let these conditions and the
rules of hygiene, be observed, and virtue will reward her subjects with a
fine physique and a noble character.</p>

<p>Woman, from the nature of her organization, has less strength and
endurance than man. Much, however, of the suffering and misery which she
experiences arises from insufficient attention to the sexual organs. The
menstrual function is generally established between the ages of twelve and
fourteen. For want of proper instruction, many a girl through ignorance
<b>has</b> caused derangements which have enfeebled her womanhood <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[pg 287]</span>or
terminated her life. At this critical period the mother cannot be too
considerate of her daughter's health. Preceding the first appearance of the
menses, girls usually feel an aching in the back, pains in the limbs,
chilliness, and general languor. The establishment of this function
relieves these symptoms. Every precaution should be taken during the period
to keep the feet dry and warm, to freely maintain a general circulation of
the blood, to avoid exertion, and to refrain from standing or walking too
much. Menstrual derangements should never be neglected, for they predispose
to affections of the brain, liver, heart, and stomach, induce consumption
and frequently end in death. Young women should, therefore, properly
protect themselves, and avoid extremes of heat and cold.</p>

<h2><a name='IICHAPTER_V'></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h1>PRACTICAL SUMMARY OF HYGIENE.</h1>


<p>1. The first step which should be taken for the prevention of disease,
is to make provision for the health of the unborn child. Greater care
should be exercised with women who are in a way to become mothers. Those
who are surrounded by all the luxuries which health can bestow, indulge too
much in rich food, and take too little exercise; while the poor get too
little nourishment, and work too hard and too long. A woman in this
condition should avoid over-exertion, and all scenes which excite the
passions or powerful emotions. She should take moderate exercise in the
open air; eat moderately of wholesome food, and of meat not oftener than
twice a day; take tea or coffee in limited quantities, and avoid the use of
all alcoholic liquors; she should go to bed early and take not less than
nine hours sleep; her clothing should be loose, light in weight, and warm.
She should take every precaution against exposure to contagious or
infectious diseases.</p>

<p>2. There is no better method for preventing the spread of contagious
diseases than perfect isolation of the infected, and thorough disinfection
of all articles of clothing or bedding which have been in contact with the
infected. Many persons erroneously believe that every child must
necessarily have the measles, and other contagious diseases, and they,
therefore, take no precautions against the exposure of their children. The
liability to infection diminishes as age advances, and those individuals
are, as a rule, the strongest and best developed who <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>[pg 289]</span>have
never suffered from any of the contagious diseases. Although, vaccination
is the great safeguard against-pox, yet it should never prevent the
immediate isolation of those who are suffering from this disease.</p>

<p>3. To avoid the injurious effects of impure air, the following rules,
should be carefully observed. The admission of air which contains anything
that emits an unpleasant odor into closed rooms should be avoided. The
temperature of every apartment should be kept as near 70&deg; Fahr. as
possible, and the air should not be overcharged with watery vapor.
Provisions should be made for the free admission into and escape of air
from the room at all times. When an apartment is not in use, it should be
thoroughly ventilated by opening the windows. Those who are compelled to
remain in an atmosphere tilled with dust, should wear a cotton-wool
respirator.</p>

<p>4. To insure a healthy condition of the body, the diet of man ought to
be varied, and all excesses should be avoided. The total amount of solid
food taken in the twenty-four hours should not exceed two and a half
pounds, and not more than one-third of this quantity should consist of
animal food. Many persons do not require more than one pound and a half of
mixed food. To avoid parasitic diseases, meat should not be eaten rare,
especially pork. The amount of drink taken should not be more than three
pints in twenty-four hours. The excessive use of tea and coffee should be
avoided. Pickles, boiled cabbage, and other indigestible articles should
never be eaten.</p>

<p>5. To avoid the evil effects of alcoholic liquors, perfect abstinence is
the only safe course to pursue. Although one may use spirituous liquors in
moderation for a long period of time and possibly remain healthy, yet such
an indulgence is unnecessary and exceedingly dangerous. A person who
abstains entirely from their use is safe from their pernicious influence; a
person who indulges ever so moderately is in danger; a person who relies on
such stimulants for support in the hour of need is lost.</p>

<p>6. While the use of tobacco is less pernicious than alcohol in its
effects, et it exerts a profound disturbing influence upon the nervous
system, and gives rise to various functional and organic diseases. This is
the verdict of those who <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290"
id="Page_290"></a>[pg 290]</span>have given the subject the most study, and
who have had the best opportunities for extensive observation. Suddenly
fatal results have followed excesses in the use of tobacco. Therefore, the
habit should be avoided, or if already acquired, it should be immediately
abandoned.</p>

<p>7. The clothing should be light and porous, adapted in warmth to the
season. It is especially important that persons in advanced life should be
well protected against vicissitudes of heat and cold. Exposure is the cause
of almost all those inflammatory diseases which occur during winter, and
take off the feeble and the aged. The under-garments should be kept
scrupulously clean by frequent changes. Corsets or bands which impede the
flow of blood, compress the organs of the chest or abdomen, or restrict the
movements of the body, are very injurious, and should not be worn. Articles
of dress which are colored with irritating dye-stuffs, should be carefully
avoided.</p>

<p>8. It matters not how varied a person's vocation may be, change,
recreation, and rest are required. It is an error to suppose that more work
can be done by omitting these. No single occupation which requires special
mental or physical work, should be followed for more than eight hours out
of the twenty-four. The physical organism is not constructed to run its
full cycle of years and labor under a heavier burden than this. Physical
and mental exercise is conducive to health and longevity, if not carried
too far. It is erroneous to suppose that excessive physical exertion
promotes health. Man was never intended to be a running or a jumping
machine. In mental work, variety should be introduced. New work calls into
play fresh portions of the brain, and secures repose for those parts which
have become exhausted. Idleness should be avoided by all. Men should never
retire from business as long as they enjoy a fair degree of health.
Idleness and inactivity are opposed to nature.</p>

<p>9. The average length of time which a person ought to sleep is eight
hours out of the twenty-four, and, as a rule, those who take this amount
enjoy the best health. The most favorable time for sleep is between the
hours of 10 P.M. and 6 A.M. All excitement, the use of stimulants, and
excessive fatigue <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291"
id="Page_291"></a>[pg 291]</span>tend to prevent sleep. Sleeping rooms
should be well ventilated, and the air maintained at a equable temperature
of as near 60&deg; Fahr. as possible. An inability to sleep at the proper
time, or a regular inclination to sleep at other than the natural hours for
it, is a certain indication of errors of habit, or of nervous
derangement.</p>

<p>10. Prominent among all other measures for the maintenance of Health, is
personal cleanliness. Activity in the functions of the skin is essential to
perfect health, and this can only be secured by thoroughly bathing the
entire body. Strictly, a person should bathe once every twenty-four or
forty-eight hours. The body should be habituated to contact with cold water
at all season of the year, so that warm water may not become a necessity.
The simplest and most convenient bath, is the ordinary sponge-bath. An
occasional hot-air, or Turkish bath, exerts a very beneficial influence. It
cleans out the pores of the skin and increases its activity.</p>

<p>11. The emotions and the passions exert a powerful influence over the
physical organism. It is important, therefore, that they be held under
restraint by the reasoning faculties. This rule applies equally to joy,
fear, and grief; to avarice, anger, and hatred; and, above all, to the
sexual passion. They are a prolific source of disease of the nervous
system, and have caused the dethronement of some of the most gifted
intellects.</p>
