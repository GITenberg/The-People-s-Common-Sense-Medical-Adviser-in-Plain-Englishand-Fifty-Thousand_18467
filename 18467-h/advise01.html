EDITION</h2>

<p>The popular favor with which former editions of this work have been
received has required the production of such a vast number of copies, that
the original electrotype plates from which it has heretofore been printed,
have been completely worn out.</p>

<p>The book has been re-produced in London, England, where six editions
have already been necessary to supply the demand for it.</p>

<p>In order to continue its publication to meet the demand which is still
active in this country, it has been necessary, inasmuch as the original
electrotype plates have become worn and useless, to re-set the work
throughout. This has afforded the Author an opportunity to carefully revise
the book and re-write many portions, that it may embody the latest
discoveries and improvements in medicine and surgery. In performing this
labor he has been greatly assisted by contributions and valuable aid kindly
supplied by his staff of associate specialists in medicine and surgery who
constitute the Faculty of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.</p>

<p>That part of the book treating of Diseases and Their Remedies will be
found to be thoroughly reliable; the prescriptions recommended therein
having all received the sanction and endorsement of medical gentlemen of
rare professional attainments and mature experience.</p>

<h2><a name='PREFACE_TO_THE_FIRST_EDITION'></a>PREFACE TO THE FIRST
EDITION.</h2>

<p>Every family needs a COMMON SENSE MEDICAL ADVISER. The frequent
inquiries from his numerous patients throughout the land, suggested to the
Author the importance and popular demand for a reliable work of this kind.
Consequently, he has been induced to prepare and publish an extensive
dissertation on Physiology, Hygiene, Temperaments, Diseases and Domestic
Remedies. It is for the interest and welfare of <i>every</i> person, not
only to understand the means for the preservation of health, but also to
know what remedies should be employed for the alleviation of the common
ailments of life.</p>

<p>The frequency of accidents of all kinds, injuries sustained by
machinery, contusions, drowning, poisoning, fainting, etc., and also of
sudden attacks of painful diseases, such as headache, affections of the
heart and nerves, inflammation of the eye, ear and other organs, renders it
necessary that non-professionals should possess sufficient knowledge to
enable them to employ the proper means for speedy relief. To impart this
important information is the aim of the author.</p>

<p>Moreover, this volume treats of Human Temperaments, not only of their
influence upon mental characteristics and bodily susceptibilities, but also
of their vital and non-vital combinations, which transmit to the offspring
either health, hardihood, and longevity, or feebleness, disease, and death.
It clearly points out those temperaments which are compatible with each
other and harmoniously blend, and also those which, when united in
marriage, result in barrenness, or produce in the offspring imbecility,
deformity, and idiocy. These matters are freely discussed from original
investigations and clinical observations, thus rendering the work a true
and scientific guide to marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[pg
8]</span>While instruction is imparted for the care of the body, those
diseases (alas how prevalent!) are investigated which are sure to follow as
a consequence of certain abuses, usually committed through ignorance. That
these ills do exist is evident from the fact that the Author is consulted
by multitudes of unfortunate young men and women, who are desirous of
procuring relief from the weaknesses and derangements incurred by having
unwittingly violated physiological laws.</p>

<p>Although some of these subjects may seem out of place in a work designed
for <i>every</i> member of the family, yet they are presented in a style
which cannot offend the most fastidious, and with a studied avoidance of
all language that can possibly displease the chaste, or disturb the
delicate susceptibilities of persons of either sex.</p>

<p>This book should not be excluded from the young, for it is eminently
adapted to their wants, and imparts information without which millions will
suffer untold misery. It is a <i>false</i> modesty which debars the youth
of our land from obtaining such information.</p>

<p>As its title indicates, the Author aims to make this book a useful and
practical Medical Adviser. He proposes to express himself in plain and
simple language, and, so far as possible, to avoid the employment of
technical words, so that all his readers may readily comprehend the work,
and profit by its perusal. Written as it is amid the many cares attendant
upon a practice embracing the treatment of thousands of cases annually, and
therefore containing the fruits of a rich and varied experience, some
excuse exists for any literary imperfections which the critical reader may
observe.</p>

<h2><a name='INTRODUCTORY_WORDS'></a>INTRODUCTORY WORDS.</h2>

<p>Health and disease are physical conditions upon which pleasure and pain,
success and failure, depend. Every <i>individual</i> gain increases public
gain. Upon the health of its people is based the prosperity of a nation; by
it every value is increased, every joy enhanced. Life is incomplete without
the enjoyment of healthy organs and faculties, for these give rise to the
delightful sensations of existence. Health is essential to the
accomplishment of every purpose; while sickness thwarts the best intentions
and loftiest aims. We are continually deciding upon those conditions which
are either the source of joy and happiness or which occasion pain and
disease. Prudence requires that we should meet the foes and obviate the
dangers which threaten us, by turning all our philosophy, science, and art,
into practical <i>common sense</i>.</p>

<p>The profession of medicine is no <i>sinecure</i>; its labors are
constant, its toils unremitting, its cares unceasing. The physician is
expected to meet the grim monster, "break the jaws of death, and pluck the
spoil out of his teeth." <i>His</i> ear is ever attentive to entreaty, and
within his faithful breast are concealed the disclosures of the suffering.
Success may elate him, as conquest flushes the victor. Honors are lavished
upon the brave soldiers who, in the struggle with the foe, have covered
themselves with glory, and returned victorious from the field of battle;
but how much more brilliant is the achievement of those who overwhelm
disease, that common enemy of mankind, whose victims are numbered by
millions! Is it meritorious in the physician to modestly veil his
discoveries, regardless of their importance? If he have light, why hide it
from the world? Truth should be made as universal and health-giving as
sunlight. We say, give light to all who are in darkness, and a remedy to
the afflicted everywhere.</p>

<p>We, as a people, are becoming idle, living in luxury and ease, and in
the gratification of artificial wants. Some indulge in the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[pg 10]</span>use of
food rendered unwholesome by bad cookery, and think more of gratifying a
morbid appetite than of supplying the body with proper nourishment. Others
devote unnecessary attention to the display of dress and a genteel figure,
yielding themselves completely to the sway of fashion. Such intemperance in
diet and dress manifests itself in the general appearance of the
unfortunate transgressor, and exposes his folly to the world, with little
less precision than certain vices signify their presence by a
tobacco-tainted breath, beer-bloated body, rum-emblazoned nose, and kindred
manifestations. They coddle themselves instead of practicing self-denial,
and appear to think that the chief end of life is gratification, rather
than useful endeavor.</p>

<p>I purpose to express myself candidly and earnestly on all topics
relating to health, and appeal to the common sense of the reader for
justification. Although it is my aim to simplify the work, and render it a
practical common-sense guide to the farmer, mechanic, mariner, and
day-laborer, yet I trust that it may not prove less acceptable to the
scholar, in its discussion of the problems of Life. Not only does the
method adopted in this volume of treating of the Functions of the Brain and
Nervous System present many new suggestions, in its application to hygiene,
the management of disease, generation and the development and improvement
of man, but the conclusions correspond with the results of the latest
investigations of the world's most distinguished <i>savants</i>. My object
is to inculcate the facts of science rather than the theories of
philosophy.</p>

<p>Unto us are committed important health trusts, which we hold, not merely
in our own behalf, but for the benefit of others. If we discharge the
obligations of our trusteeship, we shall enjoy present strength,
usefulness, and length of days; but if we fail in their performance, then
inefficiency, incapacity, and sickness, will follow, the sequel of which is
pain and death. Let us, then, prove worthy of this generous commission,
that we may enjoy the sweetest of all pleasures, the delicious fruitage of
honest toil and faithful obedience.</p>
