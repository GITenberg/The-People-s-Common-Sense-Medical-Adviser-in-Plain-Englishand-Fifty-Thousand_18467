<p>The fear of pain and the dangers of childbirth fill many a woman's
breast with dismay. In the olden days of leeches and witchcraft, it was
considered sacrilegious to lessen the pains of labor. Latterly,
an&aelig;sthetics have been used at the time of parturition, and now people
are beginning to find out that pain and danger can be almost wholly
avoided.</p>

<p>Proper preparation during gestation will make both as rare as they used
to be common. There is no reason why childbirth should be fraught with
danger and distress. It is a perfectly natural function, and should be
performed in a natural way without undue suffering. Nature never intended
that women should be tortured when doing the one thing which makes them
wholly womanly. The perversion of nature's laws has brought this suffering
about, and a return to right living will stop it.</p>

<p>Nine out of ten women are troubled more or less by weakness and diseases
peculiar to their sex. It is so because they do not take proper care of
themselves&mdash;because they neglect little ills and little precautions. A
woman in perfectly hearty health goes through her time of trial with
comparative ease. The thing to do then, is to make all pregnant women
healthy&mdash;to strengthen them generally and locally. The medicine and tonic
to do it with is Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription.</p>

<p>It is a powerful invigorant and nervine. It soothes and strengthens the
nerves and acts directly on the feminine organism in a way which fits it
for the proper and regular performance of all its functions at ill
times.</p>

<p>Taken during gestation it robs childbirth of its dangers to both mother
and child, by preparing the system for delivery, thereby shortening <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682"></a>[pg 682]</span>labor,
lessening pain and abbreviating the period of confinement. The Favorite
Prescription also promotes the secretion of an abundance of nourishment for
the child, if taken after confinement, besides building up the mother's
strength and making her recovery more perfect.</p>


<h3>ABORTION. (MISCARRIAGE.)</h3>

<p>The term <i>abortion</i> is used to denote the premature expulsion of
the foetus. If the expulsion takes place within four months after
impregnation, it is termed <i>abortion</i>; if between the fourth and
seventh month, <i>miscarriage</i>; if after the seventh month, but before
the completion of the full period of gestation, <i>premature labor</i>.</p>

<p>Abortion may be due to those agents which act directly upon the uterus
and cause the expulsion of the foetus; to those which occasion the death of
the foetus, thereby effecting its ejection; and it may be <i>criminal</i>,
that is, produced intentionally by direct agencies intended for that
purpose.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The premonitory symptoms are pain in the loins and
lower part of the back, a dull pain in the abdomen and thighs, nausea,
chills, and palpitation. The membranes and blood-vessels of the uterus
become lacerated, causing profuse hemorrhage. The discharge of blood from
the vagina is sometimes attended with excessive pain.</p>

<p><b>The Causes</b> which act directly upon the uterus to produce abortion
may be violent exercise, lifting, accidents, or injuries from blows or
falls. Nervous susceptibilities, a plethoric condition of the system,
an&aelig;mia, exhaustive discharges, use of improper food, uterine
displacements, congestion caused by excessive sexual excitement, general
debility or muscular irritability, which is sometimes so great as to
produce contractility of the uterus before the term of pregnancy is
completed, inflammation of the cervix, ulcerations of the uterus, or any
previously existing disease may produce abortion. When it has once taken
place, it is apt to recur at about the same time in subsequent
pregnancies.</p>

<p>The death of the foetus may be occasioned by a diseased condition of the
embryo, amnion, or placenta, and also by convulsions or peritoneal
inflammation.</p>

<p><b>Criminal Abortion</b> is secretly practiced by women who desire to
rid themselves of the evidence of immorality, and by those in wedlock who
wish to avoid the care and responsibility of rearing offspring. Statistics
show that it is very prevalent, undermining the health of women and
corrupting the morals of society. We cannot pass over this subject in
silence. Those who frustrate the processes of nature by violating the laws
of life incur just penalties. All the functions of life and body are
vitally concerned in reproduction. Any infraction of the Divine law, "Thou
shalt not kill," is inevitably followed by punishment. The obligations to
nature cannot be evaded without inevitable <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_683" id="Page_683"></a>[pg 683]</span>penal effects.
Furthermore, all such transgressors carry with them the consciousness of
guilt and the feeling of secret woe.</p>

<blockquote>
"O God! that horrid, horrid dream<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besets me now awake!<br />
Again, again, with dizzy brain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human life I take,<br />
And my red right hand grows raging hot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Cranmer's at the stake."&mdash;HOOD.<br />
</blockquote>

<p>What shall we say concerning abortionists, men and women who are willing
to engage in the murder of innocents for pay? True, there may be
circumstances in which it is not right to continue in the pregnant
condition, such as when the children of an unfortunate marriage are idiots,
or the pelvis of the woman is so deformed that she cannot bear a living
child. All such cases should be submitted to the <i>family</i> physician,
who ought to be made acquainted with all the circumstances and facts
relating to the case, when he can summon other physicians for counsel, and
their deliberations may determine the propriety or necessity of bringing on
an abortion.</p>

<p>Parties have written to us and others have made personal application
under circumstances when it might have been right for their <i>family
physician</i> to have induced abortion. We wish to have it distinctly
understood that we will not under any circumstances prescribe medicines or
perform any operation to relieve women of pregnancy.</p>

<p>Mechanical means are resorted to by abortionists, and many women produce
abortion upon themselves. It always terminates in lasting injury and
sometimes in speedy death. Certain medicines will sometimes produce
abortion but they are very unsafe. An opinion is very prevalent that if
abortion be produced before the movements of the foetus are felt, there is
no crime committed. It should be remembered that <i>life begins with
conception</i>, and, at whatever period of pregnancy abortion is committed,
<i>life is destroyed</i>. Whoever disobeys the Divine injunction cannot
escape his own consciousness of the deed, and the anguish and bitter
remorse which ever after disturb the soul.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In threatened abortion, there is pain in the back or
lower part of the abdomen, and later some flow of blood. The first object
is to obtain perfect rest and quiet, and assume the recumbent position. By
lying down, the blood will be more easily diverted to the surface of the
body. Gallic acid, in doses of five grains every two or three hours, is
often a valuable agent to arrest the hemorrhage, but opium in some form
should be relied upon principally. A Dover's powder, ten grains, may be
administered, to assist in determining the blood to the surface and
extremities of the body and to allay irritation. The room should be cool,
the patient should lie on a hard bed, and all company should be avoided,
for excitement favors abortion. If the flow of blood equals a gill in
amount, there is little hope of preventing abortion, and the treatment of
the case should be entrusted to the family physician.</p>

<h2>WOMAN AND HER DISEASES.</h2>


<p>An imaginative poet avers that woman is the link connecting Heaven and
earth. True it is, we see in her the embodiment of purity and heavenly
graces, the most perfect combination of modesty, devotion, patience,
affection, gratitude and loveliness, and the perfection of physical beauty.
We watch with deep interest the steady and gradual development from
girlhood to womanhood, when the whole person improves in grace and
elegance, the voice becomes more sonorous and melodious, and the angles and
curvatures of her contour become more rounded and amplified, preparatory
for her high and holy mission.</p>

<p>The uterus, or womb, and ovaries, with which her whole system is in
intimate sympathy, render her doubly susceptible to injurious influences
and a resulting series of diseases, from which the other sex is entirely
exempt. By their sympathetic connections they wield a modifying influence
over all the other functions of the system. Physically and mentally, woman
is man modified, perfected,&mdash;the last and crowning handiwork of God. When,
therefore, this structure so wonderfully endowed, so exquisitely wrought,
and performing the most delicate and sacred functions which God has ever
entrusted to a created being, is disturbed by disease, when the
nicely-adjusted balance of her complex nature deviates from its true and
intended poise, the most efficient aid should be extended, in order that
the normal equilibrium may be regained, her health restored, and her divine
mission, on which human welfare so largely depends, be fulfilled. Its
importance should elicit the best efforts of the highest type of mind, the
ripe development of genius, and the most scientific administration of the
choicest, rarest, and purest medicinal elements in the whole range of
nature.</p>

<p><b>A Vast Experience</b>. As the remedial management of diseases of
women has, for many years, entered very largely into our practice at the
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, located at 663 Main Street,
Buffalo, N.Y., comprising the treatment of many thousands of cases
annually, we have been afforded great experience in perfecting and adapting
remedies for their cure, enabling us to meet their requirements with
increased <i>certainty</i> and <i>exactness</i>.</p>

<p><b>Treating the Wrong Disease</b>. Our improved and perfected system of
diagnosing, or determining, the <i>exact</i> nature and extent of chronic
affections, which, in most cases, we are able to do at a distance, and
without a personal examination of the patient, as will be more particularly
explained in the appendix, or latter part of this little book, has enabled
us to avoid the blunders so often committed by the general practitioner,
who not infrequently treats those afflicted with chronic ailments peculiar
to women, for long weeks, and perhaps months, without ever discovering
their real and true disease, or condition. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_685" id="Page_685"></a>[pg 685]</span>Thus, invalid women are
often uselessly subjected to treatment for dyspepsia, heart disease, liver
or kidney affections, sick headaches, and various aches and pains, as if
they were <i>primary</i> diseases, when in reality, they are only so many
local manifestations, or <i>symptoms</i>, of some overlooked derangement,
or disease, of the womb. For, as we have already intimated, every organ of
the system is in <i>intimate</i> sympathy with the uterus, or womb. Any
disease, either functional or organic, of this organ, is at once manifest
through several, if not all, the sympathizing organs of the system. When we
receive a sharp blow upon the elbow, the pain is felt most keenly in our
little finger. Just so in diseases of the womb; often the most distress is
felt in organs or parts of the system quite distant from the real seat of
disease. On this account, thoughtless, easy-going and ignorant physicians
are misled, and very commonly mistake the invalid's disease for some
affection of the stomach, heart, liver, kidneys, or other organ, when
really it is located in the uterus. Cure the disease of the womb, and all
these disagreeable manifestations, or symptoms, vanish. Their cause being
removed, the various dependent derangements, and disagreeable nervous
sensations and sufferings rapidly give way, and vigorous health is firmly
re-established.</p>

<p><b>Time and Perseverance in Treatment Required to Cure</b>. Most chronic
diseases of women are slow in their inception, or development, and their
removal or cure must necessarily be gradual. Disease that has been
progressing and becoming more firmly established for months, or perhaps
years, cannot, except in rare cases, be hastily dislodged, and the system
restored to perfect health. The process of cure, like the development and
progress of the disease, must be a gradual one, accomplished step by step.
Often, too, the use of medicines that, if <i>persisted</i> in, will prove
beneficial and curative, will, for a considerable time, arouse in the
system very disagreeable sensations, and many times this leads unthinking
persons to become frightened or discouraged, and to quit the treatment best
adapted to their cases if only faithfully carried out. In many forms of
womb disease, their are organic lesions or changes, that can be repaired
only by a gradual process, just as an external wound would heal,&mdash;not
suddenly, but by a constant, slow filling in and building up, or by the
gradual development or growth of one cell upon another. Just as a great
breach in a wall would be repaired by filling in brick upon brick, until
the defect is effaced, so must these lesion's be removed by gradual
processes. When fully repaired, the dependent, sympathetic derangements,
disagreeable sensations, and all the long train of consequential symptoms
are, one by one, abolished.</p>

<p><b>Not Limited in Our Remedial Resources</b>. It should be borne in mind
that, while we recommend, in this little volume, certain courses of
treatment for ordinary cases, the remedies mentioned do not by any means
embrace all our resources in the way of medicines and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686"></a>[pg 686]</span>other
curative agencies, especially for complicated, difficult, or very obstinate
cases. In many of the latter class we can send medicines that are exactly
adapted to the case, if the invalid will fill out one of our "Applications
for Treatment," which may be found folded in the latter part of this book,
or which will be sent to any address, on application, by mail. In most womb
diseases, the chemical and microscopical examination of the urine also
furnishes valuable aid in determining the exact condition of the patient,
as well as the precise stage of the local organic disease. Full directions
for putting up and sending such samples may be found in the "Appendix" of
this little volume. Every case submitted to us, either by letter or in
person, receives the careful and deliberate consideration of a full Council
of specialists before a decision as to the nature of the malady, or the
proper course of treatment to be employed, is determined upon. The great
advantage of this system of practice must be obvious to every intelligent,
thoughtful person. No experimenting is ever resorted to. The treatment is
<i>specially</i> and <i>exactly</i> adapted to each individual case, which
requires such judgment, skill, and nicety of discrimination, as has only
been acquired by our specialists through long and diligent study, and an
experience embracing the treatment annually of many thousands of cases of
those chronic diseases which are peculiar to women.</p>

<h3>MENSTRUATION AND ITS DISORDERS.</h3>

<p>The function of the ovaries is to furnish ova or germs, and the
functions of the uterus or womb are to secrete mucus; to exude the menses;
to secrete the decidua; to contain and nourish the foetus and to effect its
expulsion.</p>

<p>Menstruation, or the menses, monthly visitation, catamenia, menstrual
flow, courses, or periods, usually makes its appearance in the female
between the twelfth and fifteenth years, at which time the reproductive
system undergoes remarkable changes. A marked characteristic of
menstruation is its regular return about every twenty-eight days. The
menstrual flow usually continues from three to six days, and the discharge
seems to be ordinary blood, which, during its vaginal passage, becomes
mixed with mucus, and is thereby deprived of the power of coagulation. The
quantity exuded varies from two to eight ounces, but the amount consistent
with the health of one person, may be excessive and weakening in another.
This function is regarded as being regular when its effect upon the system
is favorable, for whatever organic process directly contributes to the
health should be considered as normal. It occurs at regular intervals for
about thirty <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687"></a>[pg
687]</span>years, when menstruation and the aptitude for conception
simultaneously cease.</p>

<p>The departures from healthy menstruation are numerous. The most
important of these are <i>amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea</i>, and
<i>menorrhagia</i>.</p>


<h3>AMENORRHEA.</h3>

<p>The term <i>amenorrhea</i> signifies the absence of menstruation when it
should occur. It may be considered under two general heads: when it fails
to be established at the proper age, and when, after having made its
appearance, it ceases to return at the usual periods. The term
<i>retention</i> has been applied to the first, and that of
<i>suppression</i> to the latter. Menstruation may fail to be established
in consequence of organic defects, or from some abnormal condition of the
blood and nervous system.</p>

<p><b>Malformation of the Vagina.</b> Retention of the menses may result
from malformation of the vaginal canal, which sometimes terminates before
it reaches the womb, being simply a short, closed sac. If the uterus and
ovaries are perfect, all the feminine characteristics are manifest, and a
vaginal exploration discloses the nature of the difficulty. If, however,
the sides of this passage adhere in consequence of previous inflammation,
they may be carefully separated by a surgical operation, and this function
restored.</p>

<p><b>Absence or Malformation of the Womb.</b> The uterus may be deformed
or entirely absent, and yet there be an inclination, or symptoms indicative
of an effort, to establish this function. The individual may be delicate in
organization, graceful in bearing, refined and attractive in all feminine
ways, and yet this organ may be so defective as to preclude the
establishment of the menstrual function. Sometimes there is merely an
occlusion of the <i>mouth</i> of the uterus, the perforation of which
removes all difficulty. In others, the <i>neck</i> of the womb is filled
with a morbid growth, or the walls of its canal are adherent, as the result
of inflammation, and may be separated by a small silver or ivory probe, and
the menses be thus liberated.</p>

<p><b>Imperforate Hymen.</b> The hymen is a circular, or semilunar
membrane, which imperfectly closes the outer orifice of the vagina in the
virgin. When of a semilunar shape, it usually occupies the lower or
posterior portion of the canal, leaving an opening in the upper or anterior
portion, varying from the size of a quill to that of a thimble, through
which the menstrual fluid exudes. This membrane is usually ruptured and
destroyed by the first sexual intercourse, and, hence, its presence has
been considered evidence of virginity. Its absence, however, must not be
considered a conclusive evidence of sexual intercourse, for, as Dr.
Dunglison says, "many circumstances of an innocent character may occasion a
rupture or destruction of this membrane. It is often absent in children
soon after birth; while it may remain entire <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_688" id="Page_688"></a>[pg 688]</span>after copulation. Hence,
the presence of the hymen does not <i>absolutely</i> prove virginity; nor
does its absence prove incontinence, although its presence would be
<i>prima facie</i> evidence of continence."</p>

<p>Sometimes this membrane, when not imperforate, is so thick and strong as
to render sexual intercourse impossible, and requires a cutting operation
to open the vagina. Several such cases have been operated upon at the
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.</p>

<p>It occasionally happens that the hymen is entire, or imperforate, at
birth. This may not be discovered before puberty. But when this period
arrives and the menstrual discharge takes place into the vagina, the female
will suffer from the retention and accumulation of this secretion, and
ultimately a tumor or a protrusion of the membrane which closes the vagina
will occur, giving rise to severe pain and other serious symptoms. The
retained menstrual fluid, increasing in quantity at every monthly period,
dilates the womb as well as the vagina, and even the Fallopian tubes become
distended, presenting at length an urgent necessity for relief.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. This condition admits of relief only by operative
surgery. The operation consists in dividing the hymen by a crucial
incision, thus allowing the accumulated fluid to be discharged, after which
the vagina is cleansed by syringing it with warm water.</p>

<p><b>Absence of the Ovaries</b>. Let us suppose the case of a young woman
who has fully reached the period of puberty without having menstruated. All
the organs which we have described, are manifestly developed, she is
healthy, vigorous, robust, and able to exercise freely or to engage in
laborious occupations. But we notice that her voice is not sweetly
feminine, nor is her presence timid, tender, and winning; there is wanting
that diffident sexual consciousness, which gently woos, and, at the same
time, modestly repels, and tends to awaken interest, curiosity, and desire.
Considering also that she has never manifested any inclination to
menstruate, we are irresistibly led to the conclusion that the ovaries are
wanting; the delicate mustache upon the upper lip, the undeveloped breasts,
the coarse features, and her taste for masculine pursuits, all concur in
this diagnosis. Thus we account for the harshness of the voice, fitted for
command rather than to express the mellow, persuasive cadences of love.
Such a malformation cannot be remedied.</p>

<p><b>Retention and Suppression from Morbid Conditions of the Blood.</b>
Non-appearance, as well as suppression of the menses, may result from an
abnormal state of the blood. The first condition which demands our
attention under this head is <i>plethora</i>. In robust, plethoric females
the menses are sometimes very tardy in their appearance, and every month
the attempt to establish this function is attended with pain in the head,
loins, and back, chilliness, nausea, and bloating of the abdomen. Sometimes
there is intolerance of light or sound, and cerebral congestion, amounting
almost to apoplectic symptoms. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689"
id="Page_689"></a>[pg 689]</span>pulse is full and strong, the blood
abundant and surcharged with red corpuscles. Such persons may be accustomed
to luxurious living, and there is evidently a predisposition to abnormal
activity of the alimentary functions.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. We may briefly suggest that such subjects should
engage in laborious physical exercise in order to expend the surplus of
vitality, and should lessen the daily amount of food taken, and use that
which is light and unstimulating. We should also prevent the determination
of blood to the head, by keeping it cool and the feet warm, and by
increasing the flow of blood to the extremities. The volume of the
circulation may be diminished by acting upon the natural outlets, such as
the skin, kidneys, and bowels. The proper means and appliances for
quickening the circulation of the blood are indicated, and friction upon
the surface, bathing, the daily use of such cathartics as Dr. Pierce's
Pleasant Pellets, and, finally, the use of some general uterine stimulant,
such as Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, will generally prove successful
in cases of amenorrhea resulting from plethora.</p>

<p><b>Retention and Suppression from An&aelig;mia</b>. To describe the
condition of the patient whose blood is low and deprived of the richness,
warmth, and bloom, it once possessed when it kindled admiration and
enthusiasm in others, is but to give a picture of a numerous class of
female invalids. It is sad to see beauty fading, vigor waning, and Bright's
disease or consumption slowly wasting the blood and consuming the vital
cells, until the spirit can no longer dwell in its earthly abode and death
claims the skeleton for dust.</p>

<p><b>Chronic Decline</b>, with its attendant an&aelig;mia, may be induced
by bad habits, destitution, or constitutional depravity. Sickly forms,
wrecks of health, address our senses on every side. All these subjects
evidently once had a capital in life, sufficient, if properly and carefully
husbanded, to comfortably afford them vital stamina and length of days.
Alas! they have squandered their estate, perchance in idleness and
luxurious living, or have wasted it in vanities or misdirected ambition.
Having become bankrupts in health, there is necessarily a failure of the
menstrual function, and then follows a <i>panic</i>. All the blame of the
insolvency and general derangement, is unjustly attributed to the
non-performance of the duties of the uterus. Thus, this organ is altogether
<i>dependent</i> Upon the general health for its functional ability, yet
frequently treatment is instituted to compel menstruation, regardless of
the condition of the system. Thus the enfeebled uterus is wrongfully held
responsible for general disorder, because it ceases to act, when <i>by
acting</i> it would further deplete the blood and thus materially
contribute to the already existing chronic decline.</p>

<p>No matter what are the causes of this decline, whether they are the
follies of fashion, the effect of indolence, debility in consequence of
insufficient food, perversion of nutrition by irregular habits, lack of
exercise, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690"></a>[pg
690]</span>or the taking of drastic medicines, the result is an&aelig;mia
and amenorrhea.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. We would suggest in such cases a nutritious diet,
increased exercise, cleanliness, regular habits, hard beds, and useful
employment. The diet may be improved by animal broths, roasted meats, fresh
beef, mutton, chicken, or eggs, and the dress should be comfortable, warm,
and permit freedom of motion. The patient should indulge in amusing
exercises, walking, swinging, riding, games of croquet, traveling, singing,
percussing the expanded chest, or engage in healthful calisthenic
exercises. The hygienic treatment of this form of amenorrhea, then,
consists in physical culture, regular bathing, and the regulation of the
bowels, if constipated, as suggested in this volume under the head of
constipation.</p>

<p>The <i>medical treatment</i> should be directed to enriching the blood,
improving nutrition, toning up the generative organs, and the health of the
whole system. This requires the employment of uterine and general tonics,
and Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, which is sold by druggists, happily
combines the properties required. It improves digestion, enriches the
blood, exercises a tonic and gently stimulating effect upon the uterus and
ovaries, and thus promotes the function of menstruation. It is not a strong
emmenagogue, but operates slowly, yet surely, and in accordance with
physiological laws, being eminently congenial in its effects upon the
female system, and, hence, not liable to do harm. There is danger in
employing active driving medicines, besides, no emmenagogue, however
powerful, can establish the menstrual function so long as the system is in
a debilitated condition and the blood reduced. The restorative effects of
the "Favorite Prescription" should be secured by administering it
regularly, in from one to two teaspoonful doses, three or four times a day,
for several weeks, and as the system is built up and those symptoms appear
which indicate a return of the menses, their visitation may be encouraged
by the use of hot foot and sitz-baths, and free doses of Dr. Pierce's
Compound Extract of Smart-weed. But the latter should only be used when
symptoms of approaching menstruation are manifested. By following out this
course of treatment, a soft flush will gradually take the place of the
pallor of the cheeks, the appetite will return and the health will be
restored.</p>

<p><b>Acute Suppression of the Menses</b> may be caused by <i>strong
emotions,</i> as excessive joy, or by violent <i>excitement</i> of the
<i>propensities</i>, as intense anger, sudden fright, fear, or anxiety.
Suppression may result from sudden exposure to cold, immersion of the hands
or feet in cold water, drinking cold water when the body is heated, sitting
on the cold ground or damp grass, or from a burn or wound. It is not
uncommon for women to labor in the heated wash-room, pounding, rubbing, and
wringing soiled linen, thereby overtaxing the delicate physical system.
While feeling tired and jaded, all reeking in perspiration, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691"></a>[pg 691]</span>they
rinse and wring the clothes out of cold water and hang them upon the line
with arms bare, when the atmosphere is so freezing that the garments
stiffen before they finish this part of the task. Is it any wonder that
acute suppressions occur or that inflammations set in?</p>

<p>The symptoms which naturally follow are a quick pulse, hot skin, thirst,
fever, headache, and dizziness, and the inflammation may locate in the
ovaries, uterus, lungs, bowels, brain, or other parts. No matter what
organs are attacked the menses are suppressed. The suppression can
generally be attributed to an adequate cause, resulting in constitutional
disturbance. The severity and duration of the attack and the power of the
constitution to resist it, must determine the gravity of the
consequences.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> As acute suppression of the menses is due to
derangement of the circulation of the blood, caused by taking cold, by
violent excitement of the propensities or excessively strong emotional
experience, the prominent indication is to secure its speedy equalization.
Give a hot foot, a warm sitz, or the spirit vapor-bath and administer full
doses of Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-weed, to produce free
perspiration. Dr. Eberle, a very celebrated medical author, says that he
used the Extract of Smart-weed in twenty cases of amenorrhea, and affirms,
"with no other remedy or mode of treatment have I been so successful as
with this." Our experience in the use of the Extract has been equally
satisfactory. Should this treatment not establish the function, Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription should be given three times a day until the
system is invigorated, say for twenty-eight days, when the above course may
be repeated, and generally with success. Should the case be complicated
with inflammation of the lungs, brain, or other vital organs, manifesting
alarming symptoms, the family physician should be called. The treatment
should be active and suited to the indications of each particular case.
When the disease becomes chronic, the active stage of symptoms having
passed, and it continues to linger without making the desired improvement,
all the means suggested for the treatment of suppression from an&aelig;mia
should be employed. Their use will be followed by the most gratifying
results. It should be borne in mind, however, that when we have suggested
any treatment in this volume, it is generally such as the family may
institute and apply, and does not, by any means, represent the variety or
extent of the remedial resources which we employ when consulted in person
or by letter. We refer our readers to only a few of the safe and reliable
remedies which we have prepared and placed within their reach, and give
them just such hygienic advice as we think will best serve their
interests.</p>

<h2>DYSMENORRHEA.</h2>

<h3>(PAINFUL MENSTRUATION.)</h3>

<p><i>Dysmenorrhea</i>, from its Greek derivation, signifies a <i>difficult
monthly flow,</i> and is applied to menstruation when that function becomes
painful and difficult. Menstruation, like other healthy operations of the
body, should be painless, but too frequently it is the case, that
discomfort and distress commence twenty-four hours before the flow appears,
and continue with increasing pain, sickness at the stomach, and vomiting,
until the patient has to take to the bed. When the discharge does occur,
speedy relief is sometimes obtained, and the patient suffers no more during
that menstrual period. With others, the commencement of the function is
painless, but from six to twenty-four hours after, the flow is arrested and
the patient then experiences acute suffering. Pain may be felt in the back,
loins, and down the thighs. Sometimes it is of a lancinating, neuralgic
kind, at others, it is more like colic. Frequently the distress causes
lassitude, fever, general uneasiness, and a sense of lethargy. There are
those who suffer more or less during the entire period of the flow, while
the distress of others terminates at the time when a membranous cast is
expelled. For convenience of description, dysmenorrhea has been divided
into the following varieties: <i>neuralgic, congestive, inflammatory,
membranous</i>, and <i>obstructive</i>.</p>

<p><i>The neuralgic variety</i> of dysmenorrhea, sometimes called
<i>spasmodic</i> or <i>idiopathic</i>, occurs when there is excessive
sensibility of the ovaries and uterine nerves, which sympathetically
<i>respond</i>, especially to cutaneous, biliary, and sexual irritation,
and when ovarian or uterine irritation is communicated to distant
nerve-centres. In the first class, usually comprising lean persons of an
encephalic temperament, whatever disorders the functions of the general
system, instantaneously reflects upon the ovaries and uterine nerves, and
the menstrual function Is correspondingly disturbed, and, instead of being
painless, the flow becomes spasmodic, with paroxysms of distress. In the
second class, which includes those persons who are plethoric, the ovarian
and uterine nerves seem to be the origin and centre of irritation, which is
sometimes so severe as to cause indescribable pain. We have known women who
affirmed that the severity of labor pains was not so great as that from
this cause. In one instance, the subject suffered thus for eleven years,
and then became a mother, and has ever asserted that her periodic suffering
was far more intense than the pain experienced during her confinement.
These neuralgic pains fly along the tracks of nerves to different organs,
and capriciously dart from point to point with marvelous celerity,
producing nausea, headache, and sometimes delirium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693"></a>[pg
693]</span><b>In the congestive variety</b> of dysmenorrhea, the menstrual
period may be ushered in without pain; after a few hours, the pulse becomes
stronger and more rapid, the skin grows hot and dry, the menses stop, there
is uneasiness, restlessness, and severe pelvic pains. Evidently, the mucous
membranes of the Fallopian tubes and uterus have become congested, and the
pain results from the arrest of the functional process, the exudation of
blood.</p>

<p><b>The causes</b> are plethora, exposure to cold, excitement of the
emotions or passions, and a morbid condition of the blood. Sometimes
congestion arises in consequence of a displacement of the uterus.</p>

<p><b>In the inflammatory variety</b>, the mucous membrane of the uterus is
the seat of irritation. The blood flows into the capillary vessels in
greater abundance than is natural, and those vessels become over-dilated
and enfeebled and so altered in their sensibility as to produce local
excitement and pain. It may be associated with inflammation of the ovaries,
peritoneum, or bladder. Upon the return of the menses, there is a dull,
heavy, fixed pain in the pelvis, which continues until the period is
completed. There is generally tenderness of the uterus, and also leucorrhea
during the intervals between each monthly flow.</p>

<p><b>In the membranous variety</b> of dysmenorrhea, the entire mucous
membrane which lines the cavity of the uterus, in consequence of some
morbid process, is gradually detached and expelled at the menstrual
period.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. There are steady pains at the commencement of the
menstrual flow, and they increase in violence and become decidedly
expulsive. The mouth of the uterus gradually dilates, and finally, the
membrane is forced out of the uterus, attended with a slight flow of blood
and an entire subsidence of the pain.</p>

<p><b>The treatment</b>, in all the preceding varieties of dysmenorrhea,
should consist of measures to determine the circulation of the blood to the
surface, and increase the perspiratory functions. Congestion and
inflammation of the internal organs are generally induced by exposure to
cold or from insufficient clothing. Sometimes they follow from neglect of
the skin, which is not kept clean and its excretory function encouraged by
warm clothing. The domestic treatment at the monthly crisis should be
commenced by the administration of hot foot, and sitz-baths, after which
the patient should be warmly covered in bed, and bottles of hot water
applied to the extremities, back, and thighs. Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract
of Smart-weed should be given in full doses, frequently repeated, to secure
its diaphoretic, emmenagogue, and anodyne effects, which, for this painful
affection, is unsurpassed. For the radical cure of this disease, whether of
a congestive, inflammatory, or neuralgic character, Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription, which is sold by druggists, is a pleasant and specific
remedy, which will most speedily correct the abnormal condition that
produces the trouble, and thereby obviate the necessity of passing this
terrible <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694"></a>[pg
694]</span>ordeal at every monthly period. The patient should take two
teaspoonfuls of the medicine three times a day, and keep up its use in
these doses for weeks. Frequently, one month will suffice to cure, but in
most cases, a longer season is required. In the end, the suffering patient
will not be disappointed, but will become a new being, ready for the
enjoyment and duties of life. The bowels should be kept regular throughout
the treatment by the use of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets, if necessary. A
hand or sponge-bath should be used daily to keep the skin active, and be
followed by a brisk rubbing of the surface with a rough towel or
flesh-brush. A wet sheet pack will cleanse the pores of the skin and invite
the blood into the minute capillaries of the surface, and thus prove of
great benefit. It should be repeated after an interval of seven days, but
ought to be omitted if near the approach of a menstrual period. The
clothing should be warm, to protect the system against changes of
temperature; especially should every precaution be taken to keep the feet
dry and warm. The patient should walk in the open air, and the distance
should be regularly lengthened at each succeeding walk. If the course of
treatment which we have suggested be faithfully pursued, a permanent cure
will be effected.</p>

<p><b>In the obstructive variety</b> of dysmenorrhea, some organic
impediment hinders the exit of the menstrual blood from the uterus, which,
consequently, becomes distended and painful. The pain may be constant, but
is most acute when the uterus makes spasmodic efforts to discharge the
menstrual blood. If these efforts prove successful, there is an interval of
relief. Flexion or version of the womb may produce partial occlusion of the
canal of the neck of the uterus, thus preventing the free flow of the
menstrual fluid through it. Tumors located in the body or neck of the
uterus often cause obstruction to the free discharge of the menses.
Imperforate hymen and vaginal stricture also sometimes cause obstruction
and give rise to painful menstruation. As these several abnormal conditions
and diseases will be treated of elsewhere in this volume, we omit their
further consideration here.</p>

<p>Partial adhesion of the walls of the neck of the womb may result from
inflammation of the mucous lining, and prevent a free and easy exit of the
menstrual fluid. In many cases, the contracted and narrowed condition of
the canal of the cervix seems to be a congenital deformity, for we can
trace it to no perceptible cause. It is also true that contraction and
partial, or even complete, stricture of the cervix, or neck of the womb,
often results from the improper application of strong caustics to this
passage by incompetent and ignorant surgeons. Every person has observed the
contraction of tissue caused by a severe burn, which often produces such a
distortion of the injured part as to disfigure the body for life. A similar
result is produced when the neck of the womb is burned with strong
caustics. The tissues are destroyed, and, as the parts heal, the
deeper-seated tissues firmly contract, forming a hard, unyielding cicatrix,
thus constricting the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695"
id="Page_695"></a>[pg 695]</span>neck of the womb, through which the menses
pass into the vagina.</p>

into the canal of the uterine neck with its blades closed. By means of the
thumb-screw the blades are then separated as shown in this illustration,
the cervical canal being thereby dilated to the required extent.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. From the nature of this malady, it will readily be
seen that no medical treatment can effect a radical cure. We must therefore
resort to surgery. In a small proportion of cases, the stricture may be
cured by repeated dilations of the constricted part of the cervical canal.
This may be accomplished by using a very smooth probe which is fine at the
point, but increases in size, so that its introduction will widen and
expand the orifice and canal. The stricture may be overcome in many cases
by using different sized probes. In some instances, we have employed the
uterine dilator, represented by Fig. 3. We have also introduced sea-tangle
and sponge tents into the neck of the womb, and allowed them to remain
until they expanded by absorbing moisture from the surrounding tissues. The
latter process is simple, and in many cases preferable. By means of a
speculum (see Figs. 15 and 16), the mouth of the womb is brought into view,
and the surgeon seizes a small tent with a pair of forceps and gently
presses it into the neck of the womb, where it is left to expand and thus
dilate the passage. If there seems to be a persistent disposition of the
circular fibers of the cervix to contract, and thus close the canal, a
surgical operation will be necessary to insure permanent relief. In
performing this operation, we use a cutting instrument called the
hysterotome (see Figs. 4 and 5). By the use of this instrument, the
cervical canal is enlarged by an incision on either side. The operation is
but slightly painful, and, in the hands of a competent surgeon, is
perfectly safe. We have operated in a very large number of cases and have
never known any alarming or dangerous symptoms to result. After the
incision, a small roll of cotton, thoroughly saturated with glycerine, is
applied to the incised parts, and a larger roll is introduced into the
vagina. The second day after the operation, the cotton is removed, the
edges of the wound separated by a uterine sound or probe, and a cotton tent
introduced into the cervix, and allowed to remain, so that it will expand
and thus open the wound to its full extent. This treatment must be
thoroughly applied, and repeated every alternate day, until the incised
parts are perfectly healed.</p>

each side, thus enlarging the passage. The upper figure illustrates the

<p>Many times patients cannot understand why it is that the operation of
cutting the constricted cervix causes no pain; they often being entirely
unconscious of the making of the incision. The explanation is easy. The
cervix uteri, or neck of the womb, is supplied with but few nerves of
sensation, and is almost as destitute of sensation as the finger or toe
nails, the paring of which causes not the slightest pain. On this account
we never find it necessary to administer chloroform or any other
an&aelig;sthetic when undertaking this operation. If the patient be
extremely sensitive the application to the cervix of a weak solution of
cocaine is quite sufficient to completely benumb or anesthetize the parts
so as to entirely avoid all pain from the operation.</p>

<h2>MENORRHAGIA.</h2>

<h3>(PROFUSE MENSTRUATION.)</h3>


<p>The word <i>Menorrhagia</i>, which is of Greek derivation, literally
means <i>monthly breaking away</i>, and is employed to designate profuse
menstruation. This disorder must not be confounded with those hemorrhages
which are not periodical, and which are due to other causes. The term
<i>menhorrhagia</i> is restricted to an immoderate monthly flow. The
menstrual flow may occur too often, continue too long, or be too profuse.
It induces a feeble pulse, cold extremities, weak respiration, general
debility, and may occur in opposite states of the system, <i>i.e.</i>, in
women who have a plethoric and robust habit, or in those of flaccid muscles
and bloodless features. When the menstrual discharge is natural, it is so
gradual that by mixing with the vaginal secretions it is prevented from
coagulating, while in this disease, clots are often formed.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> In women of a <i>plethoric</i> habit, it is ushered in
by itching and heat in the vagina, pain and a feeling of weight in the
loins and lower part of the abdomen, and, at times, the breasts become hot
and painful. There is considerable thirst, headache, and giddiness. At
last, the blood appears and flows profusely, and all the violent symptoms
at once subside. The rest of the period is marked by an inordinate flow,
leaving the system weak from the loss of blood. It oftener occurs, however,
in persons who are naturally weak and delicate, in which case the periods
are more frequent and continue longer, and after a time they are renewed by
any bodily exertion or mental emotion, so that a constant drain exists. If
the flow of blood is not continuous, leucorrhea intervenes. The patient
gradually loses strength and becomes languid, her face is pale and usually
bloated, livid circles appear around the eyes, the appetite is impaired,
the bowels are constipated, and the feet and ankles swollen. Lack of blood
in the brain is indicated by headache, ringing in the ears, and dizziness.
The patient is nervous and irritable, being disturbed by the slightest
noise, and the heart palpitates after the least exertion.</p>

<p><b>Causes.</b> The <i>first</i> form is caused by eating too much rich
and highly-seasoned food, drinking wine, porter, ale, or beer, want of
exercise, in brief, whatever induces plethora; the <i>second</i> results
from an insufficient or poor diet, leucorrhea, frequent abortions, want of
ventilation, inherent feebleness, and whatever depresses the vital powers.
Either form may be due to syphilitic taints, excessive sexual indulgence,
accidents of pregnancy, or organic diseases of the womb. The morbid
affections of the womb most likely to induce menorrhagia, are granular
ulceration of its mouth and neck, fungous degeneration of its lining
membrane, and tumors within that organ. As these subjects <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698"></a>[pg 698]</span>will be
severally considered hereafter, we shall here dismiss them with this brief
notice.</p>

<p>Profuse menstruation is very prone to occur in young women of a
lymphatic temperament, whose organs are sleazy in texture.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. To control the excessive flow, the patient should
remain in her bed, and assume the recumbent position until the period is
passed. If circumstances prevent strict compliance with this rule, it
should be observed as nearly as possible. Warmth should be applied to the
feet, and cold cloths, which ought to be removed as soon as they become
warm by the heat of the body, should be repeatedly placed upon the back and
abdomen. A strong tea made from cinnamon bark, or witch-hazel leaves or
bark, taken freely, will prove very efficacious in checking the flow. The
fluid extract of ergot, in doses of from half a teaspoonful to a
teaspoonful, in a little water or cinnamon tea, is one of the most
effectual remedies in this affection. Another valuable remedy for arresting
menorrhagia is an infusion of Canada fleabane; or the oil of this plant may
be administered in doses of from five to ten drops on sugar. Gallic acid is
also a good styptic to employ in these cases. If there is febrile
excitement, a hard pulse, frequent and throbbing, and if there is headache,
thirst, parched lips, hot and dry skin, as is sometimes the case, then
menorrhagia is due to an augmented action of the heart and arteries, and
the indication of treatment is to diminish vascular action. This may be
temporarily accomplished by the use of veratrum viride, which should be
continued until the flow is sufficiently diminished.</p>

<p>The means already suggested will generally prove effective in
controlling the inordinate flow at the time. Treatment that will produce
permanent relief should then be adopted. The condition of the skin,
kidneys, and bowels, requires attention for noxious elements should not be
retained in the system. To give tone to weakened pelvic organs we know of
nothing more specific in its effects than Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription, which is sold by druggists. It should be taken continuously
for weeks, in order to fully correct the extremely weakened condition of
that organ. It also aids nutrition, and thus tones up the general system,
so that in the form of profuse menstruation, resulting from debility, the
patient is strengthened, her blood enriched, and her nervousness quieted,
which constitutes the necessary treatment to make the cure permanent.</p>

<p>As women approach the critical age, and menstruation ceases, if they are
an&aelig;mic, their condition is pitiable. This period is popularly
denominated the <i>turn of life</i>. Under favorable circumstances, the
vitality is decidedly enhanced, and the decline of this function is
attended with a revival of the bodily powers. But when this crisis has been
preceded by excessive labor, when intemperance or excesses of any kind have
deranged the bodily functions and perverted nutrition, when the mind has
been long and deeply depressed, or when the insidious <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699"></a>[pg
699]</span>progress of disease of the heart, liver, or other Important
organs, occurs in consequence of irregularities of living, then there is
danger of congestion of the uterus and a protracted and profuse menstrual
flow, which favors a decline.</p>

<p>The treatment of this form of menorrhagia does not differ from that
already suggested. The diet should be light and nourishing, and daily
exercise, such as walking, riding, change of air and scenery, all will
contribute to restoration. Especial attention should be directed to the
condition of the bowels and liver. If the latter be deranged, Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery will be a most efficacious remedy. When there is a
diminution of vital force, resulting in impaired nutrition and disorders of
blood, an alterative is required which will insensibly and gradually
restore activity by removing the causes of derangement. Impairment of
nutrition is very frequently associated with functional or organic disease
of the liver, and curative measures consist of the use of alteratives,
friction baths, exercise, nutritive diet, and diversion of the mind.
Whenever innutrition depends upon deprivation of the blood or torpor of any
of the secretory organs, the "Golden Medical Discovery" will prove to be an
invaluable remedial agent, for it is an alterative and at the same time a
blood restorative. If the bowels be costive small laxative doses of Dr.
Pierce's Pleasant Pellets should be employed. The "Favorite Prescription"
regulates the menstrual function by toning up the tissues of the uterus and
restraining the escape of the menses from the orifices of the
blood-vessels. While the diet should be nourishing, consisting of wild
game, mutton, chicken, and wine, the patient ought not to debilitate the
stomach by the use of strong tea or coffee. The circulation of the blood
should be quickened by riding, walking, exposure to sunlight, and fresh
air. The patient ought to engage in some light occupation, in which the
mind will be constantly as well as agreeably employed, but not overtaxed.
By pursuing the course of treatment, invalids suffering from menorrhagia
may be permanently restored to health.</p>

<h2>THE TURN OF LIFE.</h2>

<h3>(CESSATION OF THE MENSES.)</h3>


<p>Menstruation commonly occurs at regular monthly intervals, during a
period of about thirty years. The time for its cessation depends somewhat
upon the date of its first appearance. In the temperate zones it commences
at about the fifteenth year, and, consequently should terminate at the
forty-fifth year. Instances are common, however, in which it has been
prolonged until the fiftieth and even to the fifty-fifth year. In warm
climates it commences and terminates at an earlier age.</p>

<p>As women approach the critical period of life, if the general health and
habits be good, the discharge may gradually diminish, and, at length,
totally disappear, without producing any particular inconvenience, but this
seldom happens. More frequently, the discharge is entirely absent for six
or seven weeks, and when it does return, it is more copious than usual. In
some cases, the flow is not only too profuse, but too frequent. Many months
may elapse before the menses return, and, even then, they are apt to be
very pale and deficient in quantity.</p>

<p>The fluctuations of this function occasion irregularities and
disturbances of the general health. When the flow of blood is diverted from
the uterus, it is liable to be directed to the head or some other part of
the body. In fact, there appears to be constitutional agitation, and
disorders of all the organs. Perhaps one reason for calling this a critical
period is, that if there is a morbid tendency in the system, a disposition
to develop tumors of the breast or uterus, these are very liable to make
rapid progress at this time, since they are not relieved by the customary,
local exudation of blood. It is a time favorable to the awakening of latent
disorder and morbid growths, for, at the decline of the menstrual function,
the uterus is not so capable of resisting vitiating influences.</p>

<p>There is greater liability to irritation of the bladder and rectum, and
the menstrual flow may be superseded by a white, acrid discharge, caused by
an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the vagina. Even if the system be
not enfeebled by excessive losses of blood, debility may result from a
continued irritation of the uterine organs, and cause the morbid discharge.
The nervous system sympathetically responds, becoming exceedingly
irritable, and thus implicating in this derangement every bodily organ. In
some constitutions, the change of any habit is almost impossible,
particularly if it is improperly acquired, or detrimental to health; and so
we have sometimes thought respecting this function, that the more it has
been abused and perverted <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701"
id="Page_701"></a>[pg 701]</span>during the time of Its natural activity,
the greater is the disturbance occasioned when it ceases.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. There should be regularity in all the habits of life.
Women are too apt to approach this important period without due care and
consideration. When the physical system is about to suspend a function, it
is folly to endeavor to perform the labor or assume the responsibilities
which were permissible when the constitution was more robust.</p>

<p>How the duties of each day and hour weigh upon the energies of the
mother! What intense solicitude and yearning she experiences! How unselfish
is that mother who each day works steadily and faithfully for others, and
who is conscious of the hidden dangers that lurk around her pathway! With
confiding faith and love, she commends the interests of her children to Him
who doeth all things well. She anticipates the wants of her family and
strives to supply the desired comforts, thus wasting her strength in the
labors prompted by her loving nature. Would it not be a greater comfort to
those children to have the counsel of their dear mother in later years,
than to have the bitter reflection that she sacrificed her health and life
for their gratification?</p>

<p>Unconsciously, perhaps, but none the less certainly, do women enter upon
this period regardless of the care they ought to bestow upon themselves.
Without sufficient forethought or an understanding of the functional
changes taking place, they over-tax their strength, until, by continuous
exertion, they break down under those labors which, to persons of their
age, are excessive and injurious. Is it strange, when woman has thus
exhausted her energies, when her body trembles with fatigue and her mind is
agitated with responsibilities, that the menses capriciously return, or the
uterus is unable to withstand congestion, and capillary hemorrhage becomes
excessive? If the physical system had not been thus exhausted, it would
have exercised its powers for the conservation of health and strength. It
is better to be forewarned of the ills to which we are liable, and fortify
ourselves against them, rather than squander the strength intended for
personal preservation. Let every woman, and especially every <i>mother</i>,
consider her situation and properly prepare for that grand climacteric,
which so materially influences her future health and life.</p>

<p>The general health should be carefully preserved by those exercises
which will equalize the circulation of the blood, and the regular action of
the bowels should be promoted by the use of those articles of diet which
contribute to this end. Relieve the mind of responsibility, keep the skin
clean, and enrich the blood with tonics and alteratives. For the latter
purpose, use Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription and "Golden Medical
Discovery." If these remedies fail, seek professional advice. A careful
regulation of the habits, strict attention to the requirements of the
system, and the use of tonic medicines, will very frequently render the
employment of a physician unnecessary</p>

<h2>LEUCORRHEA.</h2>

<h3>("WHITES.")</h3>


<p>Leucorrhea is the symptomatic manifestation of some uterine or vaginal
affection, vulgarly called "whites." We say <i>symptomatic</i>, for the
white or yellowish discharge, which we term leucorrhea, is not a disease,
but a symptom of some uterine or vaginal disorder. We call it a
<i>white</i> discharge to distinguish it from the menses and uterine
hemorrhages. It varies, however, in color and consistency from a white,
glairy mucus to a yellow or greenish, purulent, fetid matter. Sometimes it
has a curdled appearance, at others, it is of the consistency of cream.
Leucorrhea is the most common symptom of uterine derangement, and there are
few females who are not affected by it at some period of life. It may
originate either in the vagina or uterus, and it is accordingly termed
either vaginal or uterine leucorrhea. The nature of leucorrhea is analogous
to that of nasal catarrh. In a healthy state, the lining membrane of the
genital organs secretes sufficient mucus to moisten them; but, if the
mucous membrane is temporarily congested or inflamed, the secretion becomes
profuse, irritating, and offensive. Vaginal and uterine leucorrhea are
essentially different in character, the former being an acid, and the
latter an alkaline secretion, and, while the first is a creamy, purulent
fluid, the latter is thick and ropy, like the white of an egg. In fact, the
latter discharge is rich in albuminous matter and blood-corpuscles, hence,
its great debilitating effect upon the system, and, if not promptly
arrested it is likely to produce <i>vaginitis, pruritus vulvce</i>, or
<i>vulvitis</i>.</p>

<p><b>Vaginitis</b> is indicated by intense inflammation of the mucous
membrane of the vagina. When this affection is present the patient
experiences a sense of burning heat, aching and weight in the region of the
vagina, violent and throbbing pains in the pelvis, and the discharge is
profuse and very offensive. There is also a frequent desire to urinate, and
the passage of the urine causes a sensation of scalding.</p>

<p><b>Pruritus Vulv&aelig;</b>. The discharge irritates the nerves of the
external genital parts, thus producing an almost unendurable itching.
Scratching or rubbing the parts only aggravates the affection. The patient
is tormented night and day, is deprived of sleep, and naturally becomes
despondent. Pruritus vulv&aelig;, in its severest forms, is often developed when
the discharge is scarcely noticeable. It is the most common result or
accompaniment of leucorrhea.</p>

<p><b>Vulvitis</b>. This term indicates an inflammation of the lining
membrane of the external genital parts. Sometimes the inflammation extends
to the deeper tissues, causing great pain, and even suppuration, resulting
in the formation of an abscess. The attack is indicated by redness,
swelling, and a feverish state of the affected parts, which <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703"></a>[pg 703]</span>is
quickly followed by a profuse flow of yellow pus, and, in some instances,
small ulcers are formed on the affected parts.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The sufferer from leucorrhea becomes pale and
emaciated, the eyes dull and heavy, the functions of the skin, stomach and
bowels become deranged, more or less pain in the head is experienced,
sometimes accompanied with dizziness, palpitation is common, and, as the
disease progresses, the blood becomes impoverished, the feet and ankles are
swollen, the mind is apprehensive and melancholy, and very frequently the
function of generation is injured, resulting in complete sterility.
Exercise produces pain in the small of the back and the lower portion of
the spine, and, owing to a relation of the vaginal walls, the womb falls
far below its natural position, or turns in various directions, according
to the manner in which the weight above rests upon it. Ulcers are apt to
appear upon the mouth of the womb, the matter from which tinges the
discharge and stains the linen. Hysteria is often an attendant of this
disease.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. The immediate cause of leucorrhea is either congestion,
or inflammation of the mucous membrane of the vagina or womb, or both. The
exciting causes are numerous. Among others, deranged menstruation,
prolonged nursing of children, pregnancy, abortions, excessive indulgence
in sexual intercourse, uncleanliness, piles, uterine ulcers, and
displacement of the womb, are the most common. In brief, it usually
accompanies every uterine disorder which vitiates and reduces the system.
During childhood, particularly in scrofulous children, discharges from the
vagina are not unfrequent, owing to worms or other intestinal
irritation.</p>

<p>Among the organic causes of leucorrhea, are ulceration of the mouth or
neck of the womb and tumors. These will be considered hereafter.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. We have dwelt upon leucorrhea because of its
prevalence and in order to exhibit the various forms it may assume. These
reasons long ago prompted us to investigate it; and, ascertaining the
derangement to consist in a relaxation of the walls of the vagina,
attendant upon depressed vitality, for many years we experimented with
various medicines to find those that would exercise specific properties in
restoring the tissues involved to a natural condition, thereby arresting
the abnormal discharge. Our efforts in that direction have been very
successful, and our expectations more than realized. The treatment which we
shall recommend is rational, based upon the pathological conditions of the
disease, and has been attended with the greatest success.</p>

<p>It embraces the use of those general restoratives and specific uterine
tonics, so harmoniously combined in Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, a
remedy which has achieved unparalleled success in the cure of this
affection and won the highest praise from thousands of grateful women. It
many cases, it is well to accompany its use with alterative treatment, for
which the "Golden Medical Discovery" will be found <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_704" id="Page_704"></a>[pg 704]</span>especially effective. It
is an absurd practice to arrest the discharge with astringent injections
<i>alone</i>. The weak and lax walls of the vagina, as well as the other
tissues of the system, require strength, and this can be gained only by the
use of general and special tonics. Appropriate injections as
<i>auxiliary</i> treatment will very much <i>assist</i> in the cure. The
"Favorite Prescription" is a special tonic for the affected parts, and the
"Golden Medical Discovery" is the best general alterative of which we have
any knowledge. They may be taken in alternate doses every day. If the
patient is very pale and an&aelig;mic, one drachm of the carbonate, or two
drachms of the citrate or pyrophosphate of iron, may be advantageously
added to each bottle of the "Favorite Prescription." If the carbonate be
employed, as it is insoluble, the bottle should be well shaken every time
before using. The functions of the skin should be kept active by frequent
baths, and the patient, if able, should walk or ride in the open air, and
freely expose herself to the sunshine. If the invalid be too weak to
exercise much, she should go out in warm weather and sit in the open air.
Sunshine is no less important in maintaining animal, than in supporting
vegetable growth and health. The human being, like the plant, sickens and
grows pale, weak and tender, if secluded from the sunlight. The apartments
occupied should be thoroughly ventilated. Many women are sickly and feeble
because they live in badly ventilated rooms.</p>

<p>We cannot too strongly urge in this, as in all other chronic diseases
peculiar to women, that the bowels be kept regular. Frequent, but small
doses of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets will prove most beneficial. If the
vaginal passage is tender and irritable, an infusion, or tea of
slippery-elm bark is very soothing, and may be used freely with a vaginal
syringe. Whatever injection is employed, should be preceded by the free use
of Castile soap and warm water, to thoroughly cleanse the parts. One part
of glycerine to six parts of water is a soothing lotion when there is much
tenderness, heat, and pain in the vagina. If there be no great tenderness
in the vagina, or if the acute, inflammatory symptoms have yielded to the
lotions already suggested, then a tonic and astringent injection should be
employed.</p>

<p>For this purpose a wash made by dissolving one of DR. PIERCE'S PURIFYING
AND STRENGTHENING LOTION TABLETS, in one pint of hot water is a superior
application and will not fail to be of great benefit in controlling the
disagreeable drain. If your medicine dealer is not supplied with these,
mail 25 cents in one-cent stamps to us and we will forward a box of the
Lotion Tablets by return post.</p>

<p>These Lotion Tablets have for many years been used in the treatment of
obstinate cases of leucorrhea at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute, and their efficiency has been alike gratifying to both patient
and physician.</p>

<p>If <i>pruritus</i> or severe itching, be also a symptom, the itching
will readily yield if the parts be cleansed with Castile or other fine soap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705"></a>[pg
705]</span>and warm water, followed by the application of a compound
composed of two ounces of glycerine, one ounce of rose-water, and one
drachm of sulphite of soda; or, for the sulphite of soda, two drachms of
borax may be substituted. The following lotion is a good one to relieve
pruritus: sugar of lead, two drachms; carbolic acid, half a drachm;
laudanum, four ounces; glycerine, four ounces; water, four pints; mix. This
may be applied to the itching parts, and also injected into the vagina.</p>

Fig. 6. FOUNTAIN SYRINGE." src="images/advise445.png" /></a><br />Fig. 6.
FOUNTAIN SYRINGE.</p>

<p><b>How to Use Vaginal Injections</b>. We usually recommend the Fountain
Syringe illustrated in Fig. 6, as the most convenient instrument for
administering vaginal injections. The fountains supplied by us are of soft
rubber, and have extra nozzles, with which to make rectal, nasal or ear
irrigations. There is also a large, long nozzle for vaginal injections.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise446"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 7. SOFT RUBBER-BULB SYRINGE" src="images/advise446.png" /></a><br
/>Fig. 7. SOFT RUBBER-BULB SYRINGE</p>

<p>It is channeled so is to permit the free clearing <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706"></a>[pg 706]</span>away of
the secretions as the Douche is employed. The Fountain Syringe can he used
without assistance, the flow of fluid is gradual, and with a force that can
be varied, by raising or lowering the reservoir, yet is never so great as
to be liable to produce injurious effects.</p>

<p>The syringes usually sold with small nozzles or pipes are of little or
no value for vaginal injections. In many instances so small a tube will
pass readily into the canal of the uterus, and hence there has frequently
resulted an injection of a portion of the fluid into the uterus itself,
producing severe pain. It is important, therefore, in using the Vaginal
Douche to employ only a large tube that has grooves in its surface for the
free clearing away of the fluid as it runs from the fountain.</p>

<p>Where it is desired to obtain relief from a congested, inflamed or
sensitive and irritable state of the mucous surface, the employment of a
large quantity of water as hot as it can be borne, is of the greatest
remedial value. It rapidly diminishes the size of the blood vessels, and
aids in bringing about a normal circulation in the parts.</p>

<p>As a rule, in taking the Douche with the Fountain Syringe the rubber bag
is filled, and suspended from a nail or hook at a height of from two to
five feet above the patient, and the fluid passes through the tube by force
of gravity, thus requiring no muscular exercise. The force of the stream
depends upon the height of the fountain above the outlet nozzle. It is only
necessary that the patient should assume a comfortable position where the
fluid which comes from the vaginal canal can flow into a water closet, or
any convenient vessel.</p>

<p>After a thorough cleansing of the vaginal surfaces of mucus, by means of
the warm or hot water, it is sometimes advisable to inject remedial fluids.
These injections may readily be made with the fountain or bulb syringe,
introducing not less than from two to four ounces. This may be retained
sufficiently long to exert its remedial effects upon the mucous surface,
which usually takes from five to eight minutes. The hips should be
elevated, and the nozzle of the syringe surrounded by a napkin or other
similar material, upon which moderate compression can be made so as to
retain the fluid in the vagina for the necessary period.</p>

<p>When suffering from any uterine trouble, it is necessary to avoid severe
fatigue. The amount and character of exercise should be suited to the
condition of the patient; while, most important of all, the strictest
abstinence from sexual intercourse should be observed.</p>

<p>To those who are unable readily to obtain the Fountain Syringe above
recommended we can send by mail, post-paid, one of these instruments on
receipt of $2.00.</p>

<p>A Soft Rubber-bulb, or Pump Syringe (illustrated in Fig. 7), not so good
for making vaginal injections, can be sent by us, post-paid, for from
75cts. to $1.50, the price varying with the quality and size.</p>

<h2>STERILITY.</h2>

<h3>(BARRENNESS.)</h3>


<p>Real sentiment and interest center in fecundity, since the desires and
happiness of mankind are consummated in marriage and procreation. How
dreary would life be without love, companionship, and the family! How
precious are the ties that bind our hearts to father, mother, daughter, and
son! The love of children is innate in the heart of every true man and
woman. Each child born supplements the lives of its parents with new
interest, awakens tender concern, and unites their sympathies with its
young life.</p>

<p>How dreary is the thought that one may attain a ripe old age with
neither son nor daughter to smooth the decline of life, or sorrow for his
or her departure! How many women desire a <i>first-born</i> of love, the
idol of their waiting hearts, a soul, which shall be begotten within,
clothed with their own nature, and yet immortal! It is a natural instinct,
this yearning of the heart for offspring; and yet little is said upon this
subject, in which so much is experienced. All that is beautiful and lovely
in woman, finds its climax in motherhood. What earthly being do we love so
devotedly as our mother?</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise447"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 8." src="images/advise447.png" /></a><br />Fig. 8.</p>

<p>Men and women exhibit but little concern, mere idle curiosity, perhaps,
on this subject, unless, perchance, there is no evidence of their own
reproductive powers. If, however, these appear to be deficient, then few
topics are more deeply interesting or investigated with greater personal
solicitude. Such persons will seldom submit their condition to the family
physician, for it is a delicate subject, involving personal considerations,
and, therefor, they prefer to consult with one who cannot connect their
unfortunate situation with any of the incidents which enter into the
history of their lives. This is very natural, and sometimes is the only way
to keep private matters profoundly secret. Being widely known as
specialists, devoting our undivided attention to chronic affections, and
having unusual facilities for the investigation and management of such
cases, we have been applied to in innumerable instances, to ascertain the
causes of barrenness and effect its removal.</p>

<p>It is admitted that the question of a woman's sterility is practically
decided in the first three years of married life, for statistics show that
less than ten out of a hundred women who do not indicate their fertility in
the first three years of wedlock ever bear children. We have treated many
who gave no evidence of fertility for a much longer period of married life,
and who afterwards gave birth to children. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_708" id="Page_708"></a>[pg 708]</span>We are unable to state the
proper ratio of the number of the married who are childless; much less have
we the right to assume that all who decline the responsibilities of
motherhood are necessarily barren.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. The causes of barrenness may be obliteration of the canal
of the neck of the womb, sealing up of its mouth, or inflammation resulting
in adhesion of the walls of the vagina, thus obstructing the passage to the
uterus. In the latter case, the vagina forms a short, closed sac. In some
instances, the vaginal passage cannot be entered in consequence of an
imperforate hymen. Again, the cause of barrenness may either be a diseased
condition of the ovaries, preventing them from maturing healthy germs, or
chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane of the neck of the uterus,
which does not render conception impossible, but improbable. It is one of
the most common causes of unfruitfulness, because the female seldom, if
ever, recovers from it spontaneously. It has been known to exist for twenty
or thirty years.</p>

<p>Chronic inflammation of the vagina also gives rise to acrid secretions,
which destroy the vitality of the spermatozoa. Suppression of the menses,
or any disorder of the uterine functions, may disqualify the female for
reproduction. Flexions of the uterus, displacements, congestions, and local
debility, may likewise prevent fertility. Sterility may result from
impaired ovarian innervation or undue excitement of the nerves, either of
which deranges the process of ovulation. Even too frequent indulgence in
marital pleasures sometimes defeats conception. Prostitutes who indulge in
excessive and promiscuous sexual intercourse, seldom become pregnant. Any
thing that enfeebles the functional powers of the system is liable to
disqualify the female for reproduction.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. An extensive observation and experience in the
treatment of sterility, convinces us that, in the majority of cases,
barrenness is due to some form of disease which can be easily remedied. If
the passages through the neck of the uterus be closed or contracted, and
this is the most frequent cause of sterility, a very delicate surgical
operation, which causes little if any pain or inconvenience to the patient,
will remove the impediment to fertility. In many of these cases, we have
succeeded in removing the contraction and stricture of the neck of the womb
by dilatation. When the vaginal walls are so firmly united as to prevent
copulation, a surgical operation may be necessary to overcome their
adhesion. When the hymen obstructs the vaginal orifice, a similar operation
may be necessary to divide it. Vaginismus, which will be treated elsewhere,
sometimes causes sterility.</p>

<p>It is proper that we should suggest to the barren, that if sexual
intercourse be indulged in only very abstemiously, conception will be more
likely to occur than if moderation be not exercised. We may also very
properly allude to the fact that there is greater aptitude to <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709"></a>[pg
709]</span>fecundation immediately before and soon after the menstrual
periods than at other times. In fact, many medical men believe that it is
impossible for conception to occur from the twelfth day following
menstruation up to within two or three days of the return of the
menses.</p>

<p><b>Elongation of the Neck of the Womb</b>. An elongated condition of the
neck of the womb, illustrated by Fig. 9, is frequently a cause of
sterility. If this part is elongated, slim and pointed, as shown in the
illustration, it is apt to curve or bend upon itself, thus constricting the
passage through it and preventing the transit of seminal fluid into the
womb. An eminent author says, "Even a slight degree of elongation, in which
the cervix, or neck, has a conical shape, has been observed to be
frequently followed by that condition [sterility]." Our own observations,
embracing the examination of hundreds of sterile women annually, lead us to
believe that this condition is among the common causes of barrenness. But,
fortunately, it is one of those most easily overcome.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise448"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 9. Conoid Neck." src="images/advise448.png" /></a><br />Fig. 9. Conoid
Neck.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. If the neck is only slightly elongated, this consists
in dividing the slim projecting part, by the use of the <i>hysterotome</i>,
If it be a more aggravated case, a portion of the womb must be removed.
This operation is perfectly safe and simple, and, strange as it may seem to
those who are not familiar with operations upon the womb, is not painful.
We have never seen any bad results follow it, but have known it to be the
means of rendering numerous barren women fruitful.</p>

/></a><br />Fig. 11. Version, u, Uterus, B, Bladder.</p>

<p><b>Flexions and Versions of the Womb</b>. Flexion of the uterus, in
which it is bent upon itself, as illustrated in Fig. 10, produces a bending
of the cervical canal, constricting or obliterating it, and thus preventing
the passage of spermatozoa through it. Version of the uterus <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710"></a>[pg 710]</span>in
which its top, or <i>fundus</i>, falls either forward against the bladder
(anteversion), as illustrated in Fig. 11, or backward against the rectum
(retroversion), may close the mouth of the uterus by firmly pressing it
against the wall of the vaginal canal, and thus prevent the passage of
spermatozoa into the womb. 'The treatment of these several displacements
will be considered hereafter. We may here remark, however, that they can be
remedied by proper treatment. Our mechanical movements, manipulations, and
kneadings are invaluable aids in correcting these displacements.</p>

<p><b>Disease of the Ovaries</b>. Sterility may be due to disease of the
ovaries. Chronic inflammation of the ovaries may result from uterine
disorders or peritonitis, and is commonly attended with a sense of fullness
and tenderness, and pain in the ovarian region. These symptoms are more
apparent upon slight pressure, or during menstruation. This disease is
curable, although it may require considerable time to perfectly restore the
health. When this chronic affection is the result of other derangements,
the indications are to restore health in the contiguous organs, and to
relieve excessive congestion and nervous excitement in the ovaries. The
patient should be very quiet during the menstrual period and avoid severe
exercise or fatiguing occupations, not only at those periods, but during
the intervals. All measures calculated to improve the general health should
be adopted. Use injections of warm water, medicated with borax, soda, and
glycerine, in the vagina every night and morning. The surface of the body
should be kept clean by the daily employment of hand-baths, followed by
brisk friction. The bowels, if constipated, should be regulated as
suggested for constipation. The system should be strengthened by Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription, and, if the blood be disordered, no better
alterative can be found for domestic use than Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery. If the patient does not in a few months improve under this
treatment, the case should be placed under the immediate care of some
physician well qualified by education and experience to critically examine
and successfully treat this affection.</p>

<p><b>Chronic Inflammation and Ulceration of the Uterus, a Cause of
Sterility</b>. When enumerating the causes of barrenness we mentioned that
chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane of the mouth and neck of the
womb was the most common affection that defeats conception. Of all diseases
of female organs, this is, without doubt, the most common, and, since it
does not at first produce great inconvenience or immediately endanger life,
it does not excite the attention which its importance demands. It is
overlooked, and, when the attention is directed to the existence of this
long-neglected disease it appears so trivial that it is not regarded as
being the real cause of infertility in the patient.</p>

<p>When this disease has existed for a long time, the very structure of the
parts involved becomes changed. The glands of the cervical membrane <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711"></a>[pg 711]</span>secrete
a glairy mucus, resembling the white, or albuminous part of an egg. The
secretion is thick and ropy, and fills the entire mouth and neck of the
uterus, thus preventing the entrance of the spermatozoa. The mucous
membrane becomes thickened, the inflammation extends to the deeper
structures, and, on examination through the speculum, we find the mouth of
the uterus inflamed, hardened, and enlarged, as represented in Fig. 22,
Colored Plate IV, or in Fig. 23 of same plate. Fig. 25, Plate IV, shows the
mucous follicles just as they are found all along the neck of the womb, in
a state of inflammation and enlargement, and filled with a fluid resembling
honey, giving rise to ulceration and a thick discharge, as illustrated in
Fig. 23, Colored Plate IV.</p>

<p>Feebleness of the constitution, impoverishment of the blood, a
scrofulous diathesis, want of exercise, uncleanliness, tight lacing,
disappointment, excessive excitement of the passions, the use of pessaries
for displacement of the uterus, overwork, and taking cold, all predispose
the cervical membrane to chronic ulceration.</p>

<p>The inflammation may be so mild, and the discharge so trifling in
quantity, as scarcely to attract attention. But after it obtains a firmer
hold, and, in most cases, it is aggravated by exposure or neglect, the
patient experiences dragging sensations about the pelvis, and pain in back
and loins, accompanied with a bearing-down sensation and numbness or pain
extending to the thighs.</p>

<p>The discharge is thick, starch-like, and generally irritating. The
patient becomes irascible, capricious, querulous, and sometimes moody and
hysterical. She is easily discouraged, her appetite and digestion become
impaired, and she grows thin and does not look or act as when in
health.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In offering a few hints for the domestic management of
these abnormal conditions, we would at the same time remark, that, while
health may be regained by skillful treatment, recovery will be gradual. We
especially wish to guard the patient against entertaining too strong
expectations of a speedy recovery. Although she may employ the best
treatment known, yet from three to five months may elapse before a perfect
cure can be effected. In persons of scrofulous diathesis, in whom the
recuperative forces are weakened, it is very difficult to effect a radical
cure. It is equally true, however, that under domestic management alone,
thousands have been restored to perfect health and fruitfulness.</p>

<p>Hygienic management consists in toning the functions of the skin by
daily bathing the surface of the body, and quickening the circulation by
brisk friction. The patient should rise early in the morning, and exercise
in the fresh and invigorating air. Those who sleep in warm rooms, or spend
much of their time in bed, will continue to have congestion of the uterus,
and habitual discharges from this enfeebled organ. The patient should take
daily walks, increasing the length of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_712" id="Page_712"></a>[pg 712]</span>the excursion from time to
time, but not to the extent of producing fatigue. The bowels, if
constipated, should be regulated. Strengthen the system by using Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription, to each bottle of which add two drachms of
citrate or pyrophosphate of iron. The mouth and neck of the uterus should
be thoroughly cleansed by the use of the syringe, as suggested for the
treatment of leucorrhea. The use of the solution of Dr. Pierce's Purifying
and Strengthening Lotion Tablets there advised will also be beneficial, if
thoroughly applied.</p>

<p>A most valuable course of local treatment, which may be adopted by any
intelligent lady without the aid of a physician, and one that will result
in the greatest benefit when there is morbid sensibility, congestion,
inflammation, or ulceration about the mouth or neck of the womb, consists
in applying to those parts a roll of medicated cotton or soft sponge,
allowing it to remain there for twelve hours at a time. A piece of fine,
soft, compressible sponge, as large as a hen's egg, or a roll of cotton
batting of two-thirds that size, is thoroughly saturated with pure
glycerine. Securely fasten to it a stout cord a few inches long. The vagina
and affected parts having been thoroughly cleansed with warm water and
Castile soap, as advised in the treatment of leucorrhea, the sponge or
cotton should be passed up the vagina with the finger, and pressed rather
firmly against the mouth and neck of the womb, which, being enlarged, and,
consequently falling below its natural position, will generally be low down
in the vagina, and so hardened as to be unmistakably distinguished from the
surrounding parts by the sense of touch. The glycerine, having a very
strong affinity for water, will absorb large quantities of the
<i>serum</i>, which has been effused into the affected tissues in
consequence of their congestion and inflammation, and thus reduce the
inflammation and enlargement. This is the cause of the profuse, watery
discharge which follows the application. In twelve hours after the sponge
or cotton has been applied, it should be removed by means of the attached
thread, one end of which has been purposely left hanging out of the vagina.
Then thoroughly cleanse the vagina with warm water, use the solution of Dr.
Pierce's Lotion Tablets as suggested for the treatment of leucorrhea, and
repeat the glycerine application the following day or every other day.</p>

<p>If there is no irritation or tenderness of the vagina, add one drachm of
tincture of iodine to each ounce of the glycerine, alternating the use of
this with that of pure glycerine; or, the iodine and glycerine may be used
every third day, and the glycerine alone on the two intervening days. As
the iodine will color the finger somewhat, it is well to know that this
unpleasant effect may be almost or entirely avoided by coating that member
with lard, sweet oil, or vaseline. The stain may be readily removed with a
solution of iodide of potassium. The use of Dr. Pierce's Antiseptic and
Healing Suppositories as advised on an other page under the head of
Ulceration of the Uterus will aid greatly in effecting a cure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713"></a>[pg
713]</span>If your medicine dealer does not have these Suppositories in
stock, mail 25 cents in stamps to Dr. R.V. Pierce, Buffalo, N.Y., and a box
will be sent you by return post.</p>

<p>It is well to alternate Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery with Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription, taking of each three times a day. By
persevering in this course of treatment, nine-tenths of those who are thus
afflicted will improve and be fully restored to health, fruitfulness and
happiness. If barrenness continue, the case should be unreservedly
submitted, either in person or by letter, to a physician skilled in the
diagnosis and treatment of these affections.</p>

<p>From the foregoing remarks, the reader will perceive that there are a
variety of diseased conditions, any one of which may produce sterility. It
is equally true that nearly all these conditions may be easily cured by
proper medical or surgical treatment. A frequent cause of barrenness is
stricture of the neck of the uterus. No medicine that a woman can take or
have applied will remove this unnatural condition. Fortunately, however,
the means to be employed cause no pain, are perfectly safe, and the time
required to effect a cure is short, rarely over twenty or thirty days.</p>



<h3>DISPLACEMENTS OF THE WOMB.</h3>

<p>The relative positions of the womb and surrounding organs, when in a
state of health, are well illustrated by Fig. 1, <a href='advise06.html#Page_680'>page
680</a>. The womb is supported in its place by resting upon the vaginal
walls, and by a broad ligament on either side, as well as by other
connective tissues. By general debility of the system, the supports of the
womb, like the other tissues of the body, become weakened and inadequate to
perfectly perform their duty, thus permitting various displacements of that
organ.</p>

<p><b>Prolapsus, or Falling of the Uterus</b>, is a common form of
displacement. It has been erroneously regarded as a local uterine disease,
requiring only local treatment instead of being considered as a symptom of
general derangement, and, therefore, requiring constitutional treatment.
Hence, variously devised supporters have been invented to retain the womb
in position after its replacement. It is a law of physiology, that the
muscular system is strengthened by use, and that want of exercise weakens
it. The blacksmith's arm is strengthened and developed by daily exercise.
Support his arm in a sling, and the muscles will be greatly weakened and
wasted. So when artificial supports are used to retain the womb in
position, thereby relieving the supporting ligaments and tissues of their
normal function, the <i>natural</i> supports of the uterus are still
further weakened, and the prolapsus will be worse than before when the
artificial support is removed. Besides, all these mechanical contrivances
are irritating to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714"
id="Page_714"></a>[pg 714]</span>the tissues of the womb and vagina, and
frequently produce congestion, inflammation, and even ulceration, thus
rendering the patient's condition much worse than before their employment.
These worse than useless appliances should never be resorted to for the
temporary relief which they sometimes afford. Constitutional treatment
together with appropriate applications is the only effectual method of
remedying this morbid condition.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. When the displacement is sufficient to cause any
serious disturbance, the prominent symptoms are a sensation of dragging and
weight in the region of the womb, pain in the back and loins, inability to
lift weights, great fatigue from walking, leucorrhea, a frequent desire to
urinate, irritation of the lower bowel, and derangement of the stomach. The
womb may protrude from the vaginal orifice; in very rare cases, wholly
protrudes, and may be inverted.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. As we have already stated, general debility favors
prolapsus of the womb, but various general and local circumstances and
conditions also favor its occurrence. Wearing heavy garments supported only
by the hips, compressing the waist and abdomen with tight clothing, thus
forcing the abdominal organs down upon the womb, are fruitful causes of
this affection. Excesses in sexual intercourse give rise to leucorrhea,
producing a relaxed condition of the vagina, upon which the womb rests,
and, in this way, one of its supports is weakened. Enlargement of the
uterus from congestion, and inflammation or tumors also favor prolapsus.
Abortion may leave the womb enlarged, its supports weakened, and result in
this displacement.</p>

Fig. 12. Retroflexion, U, Uterus (Womb), B, Bladder."
src="images/advise451.png" /></a><br />Fig. 12. Retroflexion, U, Uterus
(Womb), B, Bladder.</p>

<p><b>Flexions and Versions</b>. Instead of sliding down into the vagina,
as in prolapsus, the uterus is liable to fall or be forced into other
unnatural positions. When the uterus is bent upon itself, it is called
<i>flexion</i>. If the bending is backward, it is called
<i>retroflexion</i>; if forward, <i>anteflexion.</i> Fig. 12, represents
the former condition, the uterus being flexed backward so that the fundus,
or upper part of the womb, is pressed against the rectum, while the neck of
the uterus remains in its natural position. This is a common form of
displacement, and generally occurs between the ages of fourteen and
fifty.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The prominent symptoms of retroflexion of the uterus
are a sense of weight in the region of the rectum, difficulty in evacuating
the bowels, and, sometimes a retention of the feces. There may be
suppression of the urine and the menses may be diminished in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715"></a>[pg
715]</span>quantity. If retroflexion is due to a chronic enlargement of the
uterus, caused by abortion or parturition, the patient suffers from an
immoderate menstrual flow.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. The principal causes of retroflexion are congestion,
enlargement and tumors of the uterus. Congestion is liable to occur in
women possessing an extremely active temperament, as well as in those of
sedentary and indolent habits. Retroflexion is a common displacement in
both married and unmarried women; it is a secondary affection, and, when it
is caused by congestion, the menses are painful and reduced in quantity,
and there is pain in the back and a sense of weight in the region of the
rectum. In some instances, there is a reflex irritation of the mammary
glands, and a consequent secretion of milk. There may also be nausea and
vomiting, which often lead to the erroneous opinion that the patient is
pregnant.</p>

<p><i>Anteflexion</i> of the uterus denotes a bending forward of the body
and fundus of the uterus, while the neck remains in its natural
position.</p>

<p>In versions of the uterus, neither the body nor the neck of the womb is
bent upon itself, but the whole organ is completely turned backward or
forward.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise452"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 13. Retroversion. B, Bladder. U, Uterus (Womb)."
src="images/advise452.png" /></a><br />Fig. 13. Retroversion. B, Bladder.
U, Uterus (Womb).</p>

<p><i>Retroversion</i> of the uterus, illustrated by Fig. 13, signifies a
change in the position of the womb, so that the upper, or fundal portion of
the organ drops back toward the concavity of the sacrum, while the neck
preserves a straight line in the opposite direction. The fundus presses
forcibly against the rectum, while the upper part of the vagina bends
abruptly and forms an acute angle near the mouth of the uterus.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. Retroversion is indicated by bearing-down pains in the
loins and difficulty in evacuating the bowels. The feces may accumulate in
the rectum, because they cannot pass this obstruction.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Jumping, falling, or undue pressure from the contents of
the abdomen, may suddenly cause retroversion of the uterus. Sometimes
retroversion results from obstinate constipation.</p>

<p><i>Anteversion</i>. This term designates another unnatural position of
the uterus, in which the fundus, or upper part of the organ, falls forward,
as illustrated by Fig. 14, while the neck points towards the hollow of the
sacrum. This position of the womb is the reverse of that of retroversion.
In its natural position, the fundus of the uterus is slightly inclined
forward, and any pressure, or forward traction, is liable to cause it to
fall still further in that direction.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716"></a>[pg 716]</span>


<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise453"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 14. Anteversion, U, Uterus, B, Bladder." src="images/advise453.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 14. Anteversion, U, Uterus, B, Bladder.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. One of the most common symptoms of anteversion is a
frequent desire to urinate, in consequence of the pressure of the uterus
upon the bladder. The free flow of the menses is sometimes obstructed.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. The causes are tight lacing, prolapse of the abdominal
organs, weakness of the supporting ligaments, and enervating habits.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In treating all the various displacements of the
uterus, the prominent indication is to tone up the general system, for by
so doing we also strengthen the uterine supports.</p>

<p>Digestion should be improved, the blood enriched, and nutrition
increased, so that the muscles and ligaments which retain the womb in
position may become firm and strong. The womb will thus be gradually drawn
into position by their normal action and firmly supported. It is a great
mistake, made by physicians as well as patients, to consider a displacement
of the uterus a <i>local</i> disease, requiring only local treatment. A
restoration of the general health will result in the cure of these
displacements, the uterus will regain its tone and muscular power, and the
local derangement, with its attendant pain and morbid symptoms, will
disappear.</p>

<p>It is true that displacements of the womb may be associated with
inflammation and ulcers, which require local treatment, as elsewhere
suggested; but simple displacement of the uterus may be remedied by
pursuing the following course of sanitary and medical treatment. Sleep on a
hard bed, rise early, bathe, and take a short walk before breakfast. Dress
the body warmly and allow sufficient space for the easy and full expansion
of the lungs. Eat moderately three meals a day, of those articles which are
nutritious and readily digested. Keep the bowels regular by the use of
proper food. If they are constipated, use Dr. Pierce's Pellets to keep them
open and regular. Avoid retaining the standing position too long at a time,
especially when the symptoms are aggravated by it. Many energetic women
disregard their increasing pains, and keep upon their feet as long as
possible. Such a course is extremely injurious and should be avoided.</p>

<p>As a general restorative and uterine tonic, nothing surpasses Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription, which is sold by druggists and accompanied
with full directions for use. If leucorrhea is an attendant symptom, the
treatment suggested for that condition should be employed. The use of Dr.
Pierce's Antiseptic and Healing Suppositories, applying one every third
night After having first <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717"
id="Page_717"></a>[pg 717]</span>cleansed the vagina and neck of the womb
thoroughly by the use of warm water and soap as an injection, will prove of
great benefit in giving strength to the supports of the womb and its
appendages.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise454"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 22. Fig. 21. Fig. 23. Fig. 24. Fig. 25. Fig. 26."
src="images/advise454.jpg" /></a><br /> Fig. 22. Fig. 21. Fig. 23. Fig. 24.
Fig. 25. Fig. 26.</p>

<p>By persevering in the rational treatment which we have suggested for the
various displacements of the womb, nearly all who suffer from such
derangements may be fully restored to health. The patient should not expect
<i>speedy</i> relief. Considerable time will be necessary to bring the
general system up to a perfect standard of health, and, until this is
accomplished, no great improvement in the distressing symptoms can be
expected. Mechanical movements are especially effective in this class of
cases. We have successfully treated many obstinate cases in which the
displacements were very serious.</p>

<h2>ULCERATION OF THE UTERUS.</h2>

<p>Ulceration is the process by which ulcers, or sores, are produced. It is
characterized by the secretion of pus or some fetid discharge, and is
continued as a local disease through the operation of constitutional
causes. Ulcers are generally symptoms of other morbid conditions.</p>

<p>Ulcers may form in the <i>mouth</i> or <i>neck</i> of the uterus, and,
omitting cancerous ulcers and those of a syphilitic character, which are
considered elsewhere, may be classified as <i>Granular</i> and
<i>Follicular</i>.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise455"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 15. The Ferguson Speculum." src="images/advise455.png" /></a><br
/>Fig. 15. The Ferguson Speculum.</p>

<p><b>Granular Ulcer</b>. This variety of ulcerative degeneration is the
most frequent, and may exist for some time without exciting any suspicion
in the mind of the patient that she is afflicted with any such morbid
condition. There is local inflammation, and the mouth of the uterus is
uneven, rough, and granular. If an examination be made with the speculum,
the mouth of the uterus is often found in the condition represented in Fig.
22, Colored Plate IV.</p>

<p>Figs 15 and 16 represent two different forms of specula. The one
represented by Fig. 15 consists of a tube of glass coated with quicksilver
and covered with India rubber, which is thoroughly varnished. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718"></a>[pg 718]</span>That
represented by Fig. 18 is made of metal and plated. By using one of these
instruments, the condition of the mouth of the womb can be distinctly
seen.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise456"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 16. An Expanding Uterine Speculum." src="images/advise456.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 16. An Expanding Uterine Speculum.</p>

<p><b>Follicular Ulcer</b>. When the mucous follicles of the neck of the
uterus are inflamed they enlarge and become filled with a fluid having the
color and consistency of honey, presenting the appearance illustrated by
Fig. 25, Colored Plato IV. This secretion, because of the presence of the
Inflammation, is not discharged. The follicles, therefore, continue to
enlarge until they burst, and we then see in their place the red, elevated,
angry-looking eminence, which is called a <i>follicular ulcer</i>.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The severity of the symptoms depends upon the character
of the ulceration. It may be simple or associated with purulent leucorrhea
and hemorrhage. If ulceration be slight and local, few symptoms will be
present; but if it be associated with uterine debility, congestion and
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the uterus, the discharge will be
profuse, and there will be fixed pain in the back and loins, a bearing-down
sensation, and great difficulty in walking. The discharge is weakening, as
it impoverishes the blood, and thus reduces the strength.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Ulceration may be induced by any thing that excites
inflammation of the lining membrane of the mouth and neck of the uterus.
The use of pessaries, excessive sexual indulgence, injuries occasioned by
giving birth to children, congestions, enlargements and displacements, may
all operate as causes.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. We cannot too strongly condemn the practice so popular
at the present time with physicians generally, of indiscriminately burning
all uterine ulcers with strong caustics, such as nitrate of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719"></a>[pg 719]</span>silver,
chromate of potassium, and other similar escharotics, regardless of the
condition of the general system. Ulcers of the womb must be healed in the
same manner as those upon any other part of the body. It is an irrational
practice to repeatedly cauterize them, expecting thereby to promote
healing, while the system is vitiated and the vitality far below the
standard of health. Enrich the blood, tone up the system, keep the ulcers
cleansed by the frequent use of lotions, and they will generally heal.
Caustics often aggravate the irritability and interfere with the healing
processes of nature. Ladies should not unnecessarily submit to the exposure
of their persons. If they perseveringly employ the treatment which we shall
suggest, other local treatment will <i>very rarely</i> be found necessary.
This modern warfare which physicians are waging upon the unoffending womb
is a most irrational practice. Our grandmothers got along very well without
exposing themselves to the humiliation and tortures of this new-born
empiricism. We do not wish to be understood as undervaluing or denying the
necessity, in rare cases, of examinations of the uterus, or as being
unappreciative of the aid afforded in such investigations by the speculum,
and the beneficial effects of local applications made directly to the womb
through that instrument. What we affirm is, that such examinations and
applications are, in the practice of most modern physicians, made
unnecessarily frequent, resulting many times in lasting injury to the
patient.</p>

<p><b>General Means</b>. As has already been indicated, constitutional
treatment should be principally relied upon to cure ulceration of the neck
of the womb. Put the system in perfect order and the local ulceration
cannot fail to heal. If you have a sore or ulcer upon the leg you very
naturally reason that there is a fault in the system at large or in the
blood. You do not apply caustics to the sore, but you go to work to restore
the blood and system to a normal or healthy condition and as soon as this
is accomplished the open and rebellious sore, or ulcer, heals of its own
accord. All you have to do locally, to stimulate the ulcer to heal, is to
keep it well cleansed by the use of Castile soap and warm water. Just so
with ulceration of the womb. Thoroughly cleanse the vagina and neck of the
womb once a day by the use of warm water and a little soap, applying this
<i>thoroughly</i>, as directed on <a href='#Page_704'>page 704</a>, under
the head of treatment for leucorrhea, and using a solution of Dr. Pierce's
Purifying and Strengthening Lotion Tablets as there directed. After thus
thoroughly cleansing and purifying the parts, a piece of soft sponge as
large as a hen's egg, to which a bit of cord or strong thread is attached
to facilitate removing it, may be thoroughly wet in pure glycerine and
introduced into the vagina, pressed against the mouth of the womb, and
allowed to remain there for twelve hours, when it should be gently removed
by pulling on the attached string. The cleansing lotion of soap and warm
water should be used daily and followed by the glycerine application.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720"></a>[pg
720]</span>Every third night instead of the glycerine tampon apply one of
Dr. Pierce's Antiseptic and Healing Suppositories, pressing it well up
against the mouth of the womb, and letting it remain there to slowly
dissolve. This will give far better curative results than the application
of nitrate of silver or other caustics so generally used by physicians.
Besides it has the great advantage of being entirely harmless in any
condition of the parts to which it is applied. These Suppositories are
powerfully antiseptic, destroying all offensive odors and have a soothing
and at the same time tonic or strengthening effect upon the neck of the
womb and the vagina.</p>

<p>In cases where there is prolapsus or falling of the womb, or Anteversion
or Retroversion, or other displacements the use of the Antiseptic and
Healing Suppositories will be found to be of great benefit in giving
strength to the supports of the womb and its appendages.</p>

<p>If your dealer is not supplied with the Suppositories, inclose 25 cents
in one-cent stamps to us at Buffalo, N.Y., and a package will be sent you,
post-paid.</p>

<p>We are fully aware that this thorough and <i>systematic</i> course of
treatment is slightly troublesome in its application, but what system of
treatment that can promise similar success is not?</p>

<p>This course of treatment must be <i>rigidly</i> adhered to for several
weeks before we can expect a complete cure of the ulcers and the arrest of
the consequent leucorrheal discharge.</p>

<p><b>The Sheet Anchor of Hope</b>. Do not fail to bear in mind that no
difference how good the lotions and other local applications may be, your
<i>chief</i> reliance in all cases of ulceration of the womb, as well as in
those of simple leucorrhea, must be upon <i>thorough constitutional</i>
treatment. To this end Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery should be
taken three times a day in doses of from one to one-and-a-half teaspoonfuls
one hour before each meal, and in the middle of the forenoon, in the middle
of the afternoon, and just before retiring for the night, a like amount of
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription should be taken. The use of these blood
cleansing and invigorating tonic medicines should be kept up
<i>persistently</i> for several weeks; for you must not expect a perfect
cure too soon in a malady that has become chronic and seated. The disease
does not become established hastily, but is slow in its inception and
progress, and will only gradually and slowly yield to the best of
treatment, which we believe we have already pointed out. Followed
<i>earnestly, faithfully</i> and <i>persistently</i>, the use of the means
which we have suggested will rarely, if ever, fail.</p>

<h2>URINARY FISTULA.</h2>


<p>A fistula, or false passage, is sometimes formed between the bladder and
the vagina, between the bladder and the uterus, or between the urethra and
the vagina. This passage allows the urine to escape through it into the
vagina, and is a source of great annoyance and suffering. This affection is
most commonly due to sloughing, caused by severe and long-continued
pressure upon the parts during child-labor. It is also sometimes produced
by the unskillful use of forceps and other instruments employed by
midwives. Syphilitic and other ulcerations may so destroy the tissues as to
form a urinary fistula.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The treatment is purely surgical, and consists in
paring the edges of the opening so as to make them raw, bringing them
together and holding the parts thus by means of stitches until they heal.
By the aid of a speculum, properly curved scissors, needles with long
handles, fine silver wire, and a few other instruments and appliances, the
skillful surgeon can close a urinary fistula with almost as much ease as he
can close a wound on the surface of the body.</p>

<hr />


<h2>DISORDERS INCIDENT TO PREGNANCY.</h2>

<p>While some women pass through the whole period of pregnancy without
inconvenience, others suffer from various sympathetic disturbances, as
"morning sickness," impaired appetite, constipation, diarrhea, headache,
"heart-burn," fainting fits, difficult breathing, and sometimes
convulsions. A strong nervous sympathy exists between the uterus and every
part of the system and this sympathy is greatly intensified by pregnancy,
causing the distressing symptoms above mentioned.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. By proper treatment, most of these evils can be
obviated and the patient made comfortable. By the moderate use of such a
nervine and uterine tonic as Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, this
nervous irritability may be controlled or subdued, and the disagreeable
symptoms thus avoided.</p>

<p>While the female is pregnant, she should avoid all compression of the
waist and abdomen. For this reason tight clothing, stays, or corsets must
be discarded. She should also carefully regulate her diet, selecting that
which is most nutritious and easily digested.</p>

<p>The nausea which occurs in the morning may generally be avoided by
partaking of a little light food and a cup of tea or coffee before leaving
the bed. If vomiting occurs, and the ejected matter be very acid, carbonate
of magnesia, taken in tablespoonful doses, or some alkali with aromatics,
or pulverized charcoal, which can be obtained at <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_722" id="Page_722"></a>[pg 722]</span>any drug store, will
afford relief. If constipation or diarrhea be experienced, small doses of
Dr. Pierce's Pellets should be employed&mdash;one or two only at a time. Want of
appetite, headache, or a tendency to convulsions, can be generally overcome
by a persistent use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, which should be
taken in teaspoonful doses three or four times each day. Indeed, this
valuable medicine not only relieves the distressing symptoms which
frequently attend the pregnant state, but also prepares the system for the
ordeal of parturition (delivery). One or two bottles of this nervine and
tonic used previous to confinement, will, in many cases, save hours of
terrible suffering, besides regulating the system, and thus insuring a
speedy recovery. We have received the heartfelt thanks of hundreds of
grateful mothers for the inestimable benefit thus conferred. The Favorite
Prescription is perfectly safe and harmless to use <i>at all times</i> and
under all circumstances in the doses above prescribed.</p>

<h2>OVARIAN AND UTERINE TUMORS.</h2>

<p>We have space only to give a brief outline of the characteristics and
treatment of the most frequent classes of tumors which affect the ovaries
and uterus.</p>

<p><b>Ovarian Tumors</b> generally consist of one or more cysts or sacs,
developed within the ovary, and filled with a fluid, or semi-fluid matter,
which is formed in their interior. The cysts vary in size, in some
instances being not larger than a pea, while in others they are capable of
containing many quarts of fluid. In one case operated upon at the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute, thirty-five pints of fluid were taken from
three cysts.</p>

<p>The effect of ovarian tumors on the duration of life is shown by the
statistics of Stafford Lee. Of 123 cases, nearly a third died within a
year, more than one-half within two years from the first development of
reliable symptoms, while only seventeen lived for nine years or
upwards.</p>

<p><b>Fibroid Tumors</b> of the uterus are composed of fibrous tissue,
identical in structure with that of the uterine walls. They are met with in
all sizes, from that of a small shot to that of a mass capable of filling
the entire cavity of the abdomen. Cases are on record in which these tumors
have attained the weight of seventy pounds.</p>

<p>The manner in which fibroid tumors terminate life is generally by
prostration and debility produced by pressure on, and consequently,
interference with, the function of some one or more of the organs essential
to life; or by an&aelig;mia and debility, produced by the severe
hemorrhages, which the intra-uterine or sub-mucous form not infrequently
induces.</p>

723]</span><b>Polypi or Polypoid Tumors</b> of the uterus are of three
kinds, cystic, mucous and fibrous. They vary greatly in size, sometimes
being as large as a tea-cup; and their point of attachment may be extensive
or consist only of a small pedicle. The cystic and mucous varieties may
spring from any portion of the mucous surface of the uterus, but they are
more frequently met with growing from the mucous membrane lining the
cervical canal, and pendent from the mouth of the womb, as represented in
Fig. 21 and in Fig. 26, Colored Plate IV; while the fibrous variety
generally grows from the sub-mucous tissue at or near the fundus, or upper
portion, of the uterus.</p>

<p>The most prominent symptoms of polypoid growths are hemorrhage, which is
almost invariably present, leucorrhea, pain, backache, and a sense of
weight and dragging in the pelvis.</p>

<p>The best method of treatment, and, in fact, the only effectual one, is
removal with the <i>&eacute;craseur</i>, polypus forceps, or
galvano-cautery. The operation is usually attended with little or no
pain.</p>

<p><b>For more than twenty-five years</b> the physicians of the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute, have been successfully treating tumors by
means of electricity. More recently, the medical profession has quite
generally adopted electrical applications in response to the advice of
Apostoli, of Paris. The plan used however is crude. It does not compare in
results with the successful and safe procedure that our surgeons have
invented and pursued.</p>

<p>Electrical treatment will destroy the life of ovarian and fibroid tumors
if applied early and after the improved methods so long used at our
Institution. The destructive effect of electricity is modified by the
introduction of certain electro-chemical applications so that it attacks
and kills only the cells of the tumor.</p>

<p><b>The very large Ovarian Tumors</b>, however, are not amenable to
treatment by this process. The walls of their cysts become so thin and
weak, while the pressure of the fluid from within is so great, that sudden
and spontaneous rupture is liable to occur at any time and produce death.
Removal by a cutting operation is necessary in such cases. Fortunately this
procedure, as skillfully modified and perfected by experience, has, in the
hands of our surgeons, proven free from the dangers and hazard common to
Ovariotomy. This is due to skillful operation and to the fact that in our
Institution the sanitary arrangements are as perfect as it is possible to
make them. Everything is at hand in the way of instruments and appliances
likely to be required, and the entire procedure is conducted upon the
principles of perfect cleanliness and antisepsis, which obviate the risk of
inflammation and blood-poisoning.</p>

<p>Furthermore, our nurses have had such fine training and such a vast
experience in their attendance upon such cases, that wants are anticipated,
and details, that would escape those not so well qualified, are <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724"></a>[pg 724]</span>looked
after so thoughtfully and vigilantly that the convalescence is rapid, as
well as being in every way comfortable and safe. Under such conditions</p>

<p><b>Our surgeons have completed a long list of removals of Ovarian Tumors
without a single death!</b></p>

<p>We are, therefore, <i>warranted</i> in stating that</p>

<p><b>The dangers due to the presence of these tumors are far greater than
the slight risks of removal by the skillful methods employed by our
surgeons.</b></p>

<p>Owing to a change made in the an&aelig;sthetic used, the painful and
persistent vomiting that often follows abdominal operations is prevented.
This does away with the greatest of all the dangers attendant upon the
operation of Ovariotomy, and favors speedy recovery. Food, as administered
in the form of artificially digested and concentrated nourishment, is
readily retained. The strength is thus rapidly restored, and the healing
process hastened.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that the size of the opening made through the
abdominal walls is large, proportionate to the size of these tumors. This
is an error. Even in the largest cystic tumors where the development is
immense, a small incision only, is made&mdash;simply sufficient to bring the
walls of the tumor in view and admit, perhaps, two or three fingers. The
tumor is then rapidly emptied of its contents by means of a powerful
suction apparatus. Adhesions, if any exist, are then carefully removed, and
hemorrhage therefrom prevented; after which the large sac of the tumor,
which when collapsed is like a thin bag, is readily drawn out through the
small opening in the abdomen and removed. The small pedicle or cord-like
mass of vessels that supplies the tumor, are then carefully treated after a
plan invented by, and peculiar to, ourselves, which effectually prevents
any bleeding, and, at the same time, does not leave any irritating
substance, such as burned and charred flesh, rubber, silk, or any other
unabsorbable material, within the abdomen. The parts are left unbruised and
without any poisonous germs in contact.</p>

<p>Our surgeons have met with phenomenal success in removing Ovarian
Tumors, by the operation of Ovariotomy. Thus far, in a career extending
over a long period of time and embracing the removal of a long list of
these morbid growths, they have not had a single fatal case.</p>

<p>The following cases illustrate our method of treatment in a few of the
many cases that have been under our care. Each case is typical of a
class:</p>

the Tumor are shown by the dotted line.</p>

<p><b>Case I</b> A married woman, aged 38. Had never given birth to a
child. About four years before coming under our observation, she discovered
a small bunch, as she expressed it, in the left ovarian region, which
gradually increased in size until, when she consulted us, it caused
considerable pain in the region of the liver from pressure, and interfered
with respiration. Her general health was becoming much impaired. She stated
that she had consulted a prominent gynecologist in this city, who had told
her that the attachments of the tumor were so extensive that ovariotomy
(removal with the knife) was out of the question, and that, therefore, he
could only give her palliative treatment. This unfavorable prognosis only
added mental anguish and despair to her physical suffering. On examination,
we found a large multilocular cystic tumor, represented by Fig. 17, with
very thick walls, extending from the left ovarian region obliquely upwards
and to the right, so that it pressed more upon the short ribs on the right
side than it did upon the left, but which filled the entire cavity of the
abdomen. The attachments, as the doctor whom she had previously consulted
had stated, were so extensive that its removal with the knife could not be
thought of. We were not disposed, however, to give the case up as hopeless.
We told her that we would do what we could for her, but as to what the
result of our treatment would be, we could not definitely say. She placed
her case in our hands, and we resorted to the above described treatment.
She was treated two and three times per week for more than two months, at
the end of which time, the tumor had decreased in size fully two-thirds. It
has ever since remained stationary, and has given her no trouble or
inconvenience whatever. It is now seven years since we treated her.</p>

<p><b>Case II</b>. A young lady of 23; unmarried. About six months previous
to consulting us, she had discovered a tumor of about the size of an egg,
In the region of the left ovary, which had been gradually increasing in
size. On examination, we found the morbid growth to be about the size of a
quart bowl, and evidently composed of several cysts with thick walls. She
experienced no pain, and but slight inconvenience from its presence, but
she was in great mental distress. She was an only daughter, and her mother
had died a few years previously from the shock and hemorrhage resulting
from an operation for the removal of a large ovarian tumor, performed by
the late lamented Dr. Peaslee, of New York. The same course was pursued in
this case, and at the end of six weeks' treatment, the tumor was reduced to
the size of an egg, and has remained so ever since, now more than three
years.</p>

<p><b>Case III</b>. A woman,37 years of age; married six years; no
children. She had suffered for eight years from profuse menstruation and
dysmenorrhea, with a membranous discharge, and, for several months before
consulting us, she had experienced severe pain and a soreness in the pelvic
organs. Her bowels were obstinately constipated, it being next to
impossible for her to have an evacuation, and she possessed a pale and
careworn countenance. Upon examination, we discovered a hard,
incompressible tumor, represented in Fig. 18, attached to the posterior
wall of the uterus, which caused anteversion of the womb, and which pressed
upon the rectum so as to produce great obstruction. She was treated by
means of electrolysis, with injections into the substance of the growth,
for one month, at the end of which she resumed home, with the tumor reduced
from the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726"></a>[pg
726]</span>size of a pint bowl to the size of an egg, and her health
greatly improved. After going home the tumor continued to grow less until,
at the end of a few months, her home physicians could detect no trace of
it, and she has remained well since, for more than five years.</p>

<p><b>Case IV</b>. A lady aged 36: married 13 years; no children. She
complained of severe pain in the back and a frequent desire to urinate.
Menstruation was profuse, and the bowels were constipated. On examination,
we found an inter-mural fibroid tumor, represented in Figs. 19, developed
in the anterior wall of the uterus, and pressing upon the bladder. The womb
was enlarged, measuring three inches in depth, and was slightly
anteflected. A month's treatment, with electrolysis and injections into the
tumor, arrested the growth and diminished the size more than one-half, and
caused the unpleasant symptoms to disappear.</p>

<p><b>Case V</b>. A married lady, 26 years of age; had borne no children,
but had had several abortions, brought about intentionally. Six months
before consulting us, a tumor, about the size of an egg, was discovered by
her home physician. It grew steadily from the time of its discovery until,
when we made an examination, it was found to be about the size of an
ordinary tea-cup. It was developed in the posterior wall of the womb, as
represented in Fig. 20. Three weeks' treatment reduced the tumor two
thirds.</p>

<p><b>Case VI</b>. A widow lady, aged 52. She was examined ten years ago by
two of the most distinguished physicians of New Haven, Conn., who
pronounced her sufferings due to cancer of the uterus. She was then
suffering from repeated hemorrhages, and other symptoms. They gave her
palliative treatment, and told her that to interfere with the morbid growth
would only shorten her life, and that by leaving it alone she might live
several years. By and by the hemorrhages ceased and she passed the change
of life, but she continued to be troubled with a sensation of fullness in
the pelvis, pains in the back, and frequent headaches. On examination we
found not a cancer, but a large polypus, as represented in Fig. 21, which
had caused all the trouble. It was quickly removed, without pain, and her
health restored. Thus, through an error of diagnosis, she was made to
suffer physically and mentally for ten, long years of her life, in constant
dread of a horrible death.</p>

<p><b>Pronounced Incurable by many Eminent Surgeons. Health Restored and
Tumor Removed without Cutting.</b></p>

<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL, ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I cheerfully send you the following testimonial, and
hope it may induce some sick person to seek relief where it is sure to be
found.</p>

<p>We never truly appreciate health until it forsakes us.</p>

<p>For six years, I suffered all the tortures and fears attendant on the
growth and development of a fibro-cystic tumor. I tried to have the tumor
removed, but found it impossible. I had the very best medical advice the
South affords, but every physician rendered the same verdict, 'incurable.'
How that word, for months, rang in my ears&mdash;'INCURABLE.' It seemed stamped
on my mind in letters of fire. What I suffered, both in mind and body,
cannot be imagined. But for my unbounded faith in God's goodness and mercy,
I doubt not, I would have given up and died. But I trusted in Him to direct
me in the way to find relief. One hope stood out before me like a beacon
light; and that was to find the means to go to Buffalo, N.Y., to Dr.
Pierce's famous Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute. At last the
opportunity came, and I bid my loved ones a sad farewell, (not one of them
ever expected to see me again, alive) and with a sister to relieve me of
every care on the journey, we started for the Institute.</p>

<p>On arriving at the Invalids' Hotel, I was too sick and fatigued to treat
with civility the sweet-faced, lady-like housekeeper who received me, or
the gentle nurses who tried so patiently and kindly to minister to my
wants.</p>

<p>I had read a good deal about the Invalids' Hotel, and expected to see
wonderful things; but like Sheba's Queen, I could truthfully say, 'the half
had never been told.' The many ways, means, and appliances, for the relief
of poor sufferers surpassed a thousand fold anything I had ever imagined
could come within the scope of human skill. The skilled physicians were not
only able and attentive, but on meeting one, if it were every day, they
always had a ready smile, a warm hand clasp, and an encouraging word, which
alone, would make one feel better and at home. The trained nurses were
attentive and kind.</p>

<p>Every department was cleanliness itself, and kept at such an even
temperature, even to the halls, that during my four months' stay, I never
had the slightest cold. Not only the comforts of life, but every luxury
that the most exacting could demand, were fully supplied. I saw many poor
sufferers, from various diseases, made well and happy, and I too, with the
other happy ones, found relief, and that without the use of the knife or an
an&aelig;sthetic of any kind. I would urge all poor chronic sufferers, it
matters not what the trouble may be, to go to Dr. Pierce's Institute and be
cured. If any one similarly afflicted cares to know more of my case, I will
gladly answer any questions, if she will only write me, and enclose
addressed and stamped envelope in which to reply. During my stay at the
Invalids' Hotel I never lacked for anything that willing hands and warm
hearts could supply, and I came away feeling that I was leaving a sweet,
luxurious home and many warm friends, but with a new lease of life and
perfect confidence in the ability of the physicians, for I know I could not
possibly have lived two months longer, had I not found relief. To-day I am
well, rosy and happy, with a heart full of lasting gratitude for the kind
treatment and cure which I received at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;After many trials my doctors here had given up all
efforts to cure me. A tumor that had existed almost from my childhood was
gradually killing me. From frequent hemorrhages, I had become as pale and
bloodless as a ghost, and so weak as to be scarcely able to stand or walk.
Frequently the loss of blood was so great as to cause such long fainting
spells that my family thought me past mortal help. How I lived to get to
your place is yet a matter of wonder.</p>

<p>We appreciated the fact that in the skill of your surgeon lay my last
and only hope. The result proved his abilities. The restoration of my
health, when it was so generally and for so long despaired of, was
miraculous, and I cannot sufficiently express my gratitude and thanks.</p>

<p>The comfort that was given by the kindly attention of your nurses is one
of the very agreeable memories of your home-like and pleasant Institution.
With much gratitude, I am,</p>

your Institution, hoping it may induce others to avail themselves of your
skill. In December, 1890, I went to you, after suffering five years with
two fibroid tumors of the uterus. The tumors had grown rapidly for six
months prior to my going to you for treatment, and had become quite
painful. Under your treatment they entirely disappeared and my health was
entirely restored. The treatment I received from your able corps of
physicians and nurses was all that could be desired, and I would further
state that your Hotel and Surgical Institute possess all the requirements
for making invalids comfortable and happy.</p>

62 pounds, by your surgeons. Then, with kind and watchful treatment, the
care of good and faithful nurses, and by the blessing of an all-wise
Providence, I was sitting up in twelve days from that time; had no
inflammation or fever, kept gaining, and in five weeks returned home. I am
feeling better than I have for two or three years. I cheerfully and
truthfully recommend the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute to all
afflicted as I was&mdash;with tumors, or any chronic disease. The rooms are
large and pleasant, the best of food is served, and everything possible is
done by the physicians, nurses, and attendants connected with the
Institution, to render the visits of the afflicted pleasant and

invaluable service, the saving of a life, is an acknowledgment of the same.
Mine was a long-standing, stubborn, constitutional difficulty; chronic, and
defying <i>all</i> previous treatment. Under the care of the doctors of the
elegantly appointed Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute the disease
yielded. Could I persuade some of my fashionable friends to spend a summer
or winter at Dr. Pierce's rather than at "resorts" more or less unsuited to
weary or sick people, there might rise up an improved generation. The
electrical appliances at the Invalids' Hotel are probably the finest in the
world. With them the administration of electricity for the absorption and
removal of all abnormal growths, especially in my sex, is an <i>assured
science</i>, and no experiment. I cordially commend all my fellow sufferers

treatment received at the hands of your surgeon specialists. I had been
given up to die, with an abdominal tumor and abscess. My case was not
understood, before coming to you. Although operated upon twice
unsuccessfully by others, my life was despaired of. I am happy to state
that after a few weeks' stay in your Institution, with a skillful operation
which owing to my extreme feebleness, was performed without any Chloroform
or Ether (local an&aelig;sthesia only being employed), and which resulted
in the removal of the tumor and abscess, I was perfectly cured, and have
since enjoyed excellent health. I am now restored to my children and
family, and have much to thank you for. The kindness and attention received
from your physicians and nurses while in the hotel could not be better, and
I wish to praise them all highly.</p>

improve very soon after receiving and commencing to use your medicines. I
continued to use them for some months, following the special instructions
faithfully as I could, and steadily improved in health. My trouble was of
such a nature that it was necessary for me to receive personal treatment,
and I spent six weeks at your Institute. The kindness of physicians and
attendants is everything that can be wished. It is now two years since I
have had any of your medicines, and I have taken no others since, and my
health is very good indeed. I can hardly realize that I am the same person

health was never better than since the tumor was removed.</p>

<p>You will remember my case: The tumor had only grown about five months,
but it was of immense size, and I had despaired of life, and my family
thought that I would not return alive from your Institution. Your skillful
operation and removal of the tumor, which weighed over thirty pounds, with
the kind nursing and good attention given me afterwards, brought me through
sound and well. To you I feel that I owe all thanks. My prayer is for the
success of the World's Dispensary Medical Association. You saved my life
after I had given up all hope. The kind care that all gave me was something
that could not be paid for with money. It was like being at home. I send
you my picture, which will give you some idea of the change for the better
in my looks. I am now married and am very happy.</p>

<p><i>My Dear Doctors</i>&mdash;My husband had to carry me into your place but
in thirty days I walked out of the Invalids' Hotel sound and well. The
tumor that caused my sufferings had gradually developed during a period of
several years. The trouble induced an inflammation of the bladder and I had
to endure that torment in addition. There were times when I could not touch
my feet to the floor. Walking was an agony that I could hardly bear. I
faithfully tried good physicians and the various remedies and treatments
that were recommended to me without any satisfactory relief. So I made up
my mind to go to your institution. I am now very thankful. Every one I met
with in your place seemed to help me to get well.</p>

<p>You have got not only the most skillful physicians and nurses but they
are also the kindest and most agreeable that I have ever met. Your hotel is
comfortable, home-like and perfectly clean.</p>

<p>The treatment was wonderfully successful in my case. The removal of the
tumor was accomplished without pain. I can highly endorse local anesthesia
instead of using chloroform or ether. My recovery was rapid and I continue
in good health and think of you all with thanks and good wishes.</p>

seemed to do me any permanent good.</p>

<p>About three years ago, I suffered an attack of nervous prostration,
being the result of repeated miscarriages; this was a severe shock to my
nervous system, resulting in a complication of other troubles among which
was nervous dyspepsia. Words fail to express what I endured at this time.
Only those who have passed through a similar experience can imagine the
distressing symptoms accompanying this disease; I could neither eat nor
sleep, was growing very thin in flesh and life seemed a burden to me.</p>

<p>This was my condition when I wrote to your Institution for help. I
received a very encouraging letter and commenced treatment at once. I had
not used their remedies a week before I began to feel better, and as I
continued the treatment my health gradually improved. All the distressing

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I was sick two years with "Falling of the Womb" and
leucorrhoea or whites, previous to taking your medicines. I took six
bottles of your "Favorite Prescription," and was entirely cured of both in
six months; it is four years this month, since I was entirely well of both
those diseases and have never had any signs of their appearance since, and
I am satisfied the "Favorite Prescription" saved my life, for I could
hardly walk around, when I commenced taking your medicine, and I think it
is a God's blessing to me, and a great credit to you that I ever took your
medicine, for had I not taken it, I think I would have been in the grave
now, and I can highly recommend it to all who suffer from these two
complaints.</p>

<p>I was pronounced incurable by the best doctors here in the West. I gave
up all hopes and made up my mind that I was to be taken away from my
husband and baby of two years old. I was sick all of the time&mdash;could not
eat anything at all. In one week, after beginning the use of your medicine,
my stomach was so much better that I could eat anything; I could see that I
was gaining all over, and my husband then went and got me six bottles: I
took three of them and my stomach did not bother me any more.</p>

<p>We sent to you and got the People's Common Sense Medical Adviser, and
found my case described just as I was; we did what the book told us, in
every way; in one month's time I could see I was much better than I had
been; we still kept on just as the book told us, and in three months I
stopped taking medicine, only three times a day, and continued for some
time in that way, and to-day, I can proudly say I am a well woman. Yes, am
well, strong and healthy. I am so glad and thankful to you, Doctor, for my
good health, for well do I know you are the one that cured me.</p>

<p>When I began to take your medicine my face was poor and eyes looked
dead. I could not enjoy myself any where, I was tired and sick all the
time. I could hardly do my housework, but now I do that and tend a big
garden, help my husband and take in sewing.</p>

nerves were unstrung very bad: I did not suffer much pain, but I think I
suffered everything any one could suffer with nervousness; my life was a
misery to me. I doctored with seven different doctors and got no relief;
then I took almost all kinds of patent medicines and got no relief from
them, but got worse all the time, when I chanced to get one of your little
pamphlets.</p>

<p>I thought I would write to you, and waited as I thought to hear that
there was no help for me; when my answer came and you said you could cure
me great was my joy. I had taken your medicine about a month when I began
to improve and in a few months was entirely cured.</p>

<p>"<b>Left to Die a Hopeless Wreck</b>."</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;A grateful heart and an appreciation of your medical
skill prompts me to make a statement of my case.</p>

<p>At the birth of my last baby (a boy weighing 14 pounds at his birth), I
contracted womb disease. And for three years previous to treatment, I had
been a great sufferer from prolapsus. Owing to a more serious injury than
prolapsus, received at childbirth, my physicians told me that "I could
never hope for recovery."</p>

<p>After delivery, I kept my bed for seven weeks. At the expiration of that
time I tried to walk. I found that I could not even stand straight; there
seemed to be a "tight cord" or "drawing" from my left side extending down
into my groin, accompanied by great soreness.</p>

<p>After repeated attempts, with my body inclined to that side and yielding
to the drawing, I finally succeeded in walking&mdash;a violent trembling all the
while in the parts affected.</p>

<p>Three months after the birth of my baby, I tried to take hold of my
household duties&mdash;then my troubles increased, and with them came a series
of "Doctors' bills."</p>

<p>I consulted two of the best physicians, besides trying all the medicines
I heard tell of, that were recommended for such diseases; but failed in
obtaining a cure from any of them; my relief was only temporary. My
condition was growing worse each day; the womb was so low and the "bearing
down" weight so great that I could scarcely stand on my feet at all. I was
irritable and nervous with a dull headache and constipation; hands and feet
cold and clammy, except the palms and soles; a burning on top of my head.
At this stage of my disease my bladder was badly affected&mdash;the "neck"
becoming enlarged and the water collecting there caused a protrusion to
over half the size of a tea cup, leaving it so dry and harsh, that it was
with the greatest difficulty I could walk at all; a sudden jar, sneeze, or
even the slightest pressure, would force the water out, leaving me in a
spasm of pain. At this stage (22 months after confinement) menstruation
returned for the first time since the birth of my baby. I had already
suffered as much as I thought it possible to bear, and live, but my
sufferings were even greater after this; my womb was ulcerated and
inflamed; nervousness increased to violent shaking, over which I had no
control; circulation so feeble that the extremities were scarcely supplied
with blood, they were constantly cold and clammy. My sleep broken and
disturbed, life was fast becoming a burden to me, For months, however, I
endured this torture; I had <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735"
id="Page_735"></a>[pg 735]</span>abandoned work altogether; I could be up
but a few moments at a time and could not walk across the floor without
excruciating pain. There was no sleep, no rest, and after a week and even
more, would pass during which I would never close my eyes in sleep, even
when morphine, opium and chloral, were administered. My body seemed a dead
weight, while my mind was alive to all my sufferings. There seemed to be a
burning pressure about my head all the while.</p>

<p>I would have shaking spells frequently, leaving me perfectly exhausted,
my heart the while beating so rapidly, I could not count the pulsations; it
seemed to cease altogether after that, with a sinking, fainting feeling
over me, making it difficult to breathe at all. During my menstrual periods
I suffered a "thousand deaths." My appetite was gone, mind and sight
impaired, strength and flesh all gone. I was a pitiable object to look at,
divested of all that made life endurable for me. I had baffled the skill of
two physicians, and was left, after three years of agony, to die, a
"hopeless wreck," worse than death.</p>

<p>Such was my condition when I applied to you for treatment. After using
medicines only six days I began to improve; my nerves were steadier;
circulation better, hands and feet warm. Nine days after taking your
medicines they restored the function again. I will confess I expected to
suffer death again&mdash;I did not think the medicines had had time to effect a
change within so short a time. Imagine my joy and surprise upon waking next
morning to find it had "stolen like a thief upon me in the night," I knew
not when. I spent the day in grateful tears&mdash;how could I help it? It passed
off as quietly as it came, leaving my head clear of that <i>dreadful,
burning pressure</i>! My nerves were steady; indeed, my improvement was so
remarkable, that it seemed almost a delusion. My appetite had returned, and
I was hungry for the first time in over a year. I slept well&mdash;awoke
refreshed and feeling stronger. After two weeks, I was able to walk around
the house and yard without support; a day or two after that I walked a
hundred yards, visiting and spent the day. In three weeks time I went home
(I had gone to my mother's before treatment, as I and many others thought,
to die).</p>

<p>At the end of one month there was no symptom, nor sign, of the old
disease. I was able to be up all day, resting a short time at noon. To be
sure of permanent results I continued treatment for one month longer, and
have never had a return of the disease nor any symptom of it since. Before
the end of the second month, I was able to be about the house, helping the
children with the cooking, and milking. My weight increased fourteen pounds
in five months after treatment. I have taken no medicine since except one
bottle of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, four years ago. At this time
(nine years after treatment), I find my health still good, having no aches
nor pains, a splendid appetite, sleep well, no headache, no backache and no
womb trouble. I am able to do my house work and everything; can do a day's
work with less fatigue than I have for years before treatment. I feel sure
that I would have been in the grave years ago if it had not been for your
medicines. I advise all other ladies who are troubled with the same disease
to apply to you for treatment.</p>

<p>Be assured, that whenever I have it in my power I shall recommend your
invaluable remedies. I thank you a thousand times for what you have done
for me, and for the kindness which you have extended to me throughout.</p>

<p>Wishing you long life and continued success, I am, with much
gratitude,</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;Some months ago I consulted your specialist concerning
my health, which had at that time become very much impaired from the
effects of uterine disease, indigestion and chronic constipation. I was
also troubled with frequent attacks of nervous headache which rendered me
very miserable.</p>

<p>A line of treatment was outlined by your specialist, which I followed
closely, and I immediately began to improve under the use of the medicine
advised. The benefits were so marked that within two or three months I was
able to discontinue the use of the medicine, and have since that time been
enjoying good health. I attribute my cure to the use of your medicines, and
I heartily thank you for the benefits received, as well as for the kind
attention given me by your specialist.</p>

list, hoping it may contribute to your success and induce others to avail
themselves of the benefit of your invaluable medicines. In June, 1890, I
took typhoid fever of malignant type; for two months I hovered between life
and death; at length the fever left me in a prostrated condition. Then I
was taken with a severe pain in my back and general nervous prostration;
could not move myself in bed nor bear to be moved by the most careful
nurses without experiencing excruciating pain. I had the best medical
attention in the community, but they failed to give relief. My friends
wrote to Dr. Pierce, stating my condition and requesting treatment for me.
He treated me for two months; by that time I had so much improved that I
did not think it worth while to continue the treatment longer, and my
health has been such that I have not had occasion to lie in bed two days
together since. I feel under lasting obligations to Dr. Pierce, and thank
God for blessing the world with so able a physician.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I am a farmer's wife. My husband hired hands to work
on his farm&mdash;I had them to cook for&mdash;to wait upon, and my family to care
for. I worked very hard till my health and strength gave way. Six years ago
the "turn-of-life" began in the worst form with other disease which I knew
not; I had a severe misery in my back, pain in my head; the monthly flow
became so excessive&mdash;came on too often; lasted eleven days. When the flow
would stop then there would be yellow discharge of thick mattery
appearance. I had bearing down in the lower portion of the womb&mdash;great pain
all through my body: the pain in my womb was more like "labor-pain" than
anything I can compare it to; I had palpitation of the heart, light chills,
hay fever; had pain in my stomach like colic. My womb was very low down;
the mouth was a large hard knot&mdash;was so sore I was compelled to have a soft
seat to sit on; severe pains in my thighs; pain down the sides of the
abdomen; pain in my breast, pain between my shoulders; my bowels costive;
my nervous system prostrated; my digestion impaired; I had a desire to
urinate all the time, could not pass only a few drops at a time; on
standing a few hours, it would form a crust on the chamber&mdash;red, grainy
substance; I was bloated all over my body. My feet and legs were swelled
tight, and I was in so much pain day and night I could not sleep; I could
not eat any food only a little sweet milk and a little corn-bread; I lived
in this way for four years; I could not walk across the room. I was treated
by four of the best doctors in the land; the first three gave me no
relief&mdash;the fourth built up my health to some extent; none of them could
cure me&mdash;none of the four could regulate the menstrual flow, they could not
cure those offensive discharges. I was given up to die by all four of them;
my family and friends expected every day I would die.</p>

<p>I got one of your Memorandum Books; I read it carefully, and I was
hoping all this time for some relief&mdash;I hoped all the time for relief. My
husband decided to write to you&mdash;ask your advice, believing you could give
me relief; though I felt ashamed to tell a gentleman, a doctor I never saw,
those things concerning my afflictions; but I was suffering terribly. I
hoped for relief and I found it. I am happy to tell you I am well. I was
spared to be cured by your good advice and good medicine and to spread your
fame.</p>

<p>When I received the book you sent me and a letter telling me what to
take, and what it would do for me, I was very feeble; I had just got up
from one of those bad spells&mdash;so weak that I could not sit up for more than
an hour at a time. My husband went and got the medicine and a syringe. I
began its use, as you advised, and took the medicine as you directed; I
have taken your medicine seven months; the first month my improvement was
slow; I began to have strength; my pain began to banish; my appetite began
to come; I commenced to sleep sound and the bloating began to go down; the
pain in my head was gone; palpitation of the heart, also the misery in my
back disappeared; the pain in my womb began to banish; the first time the
monthly flow appeared, it was controlled&mdash;it was regulated&mdash;it went so
light with me that I could go all the time without a cane. I have not had
one spell to confine me to bed in seven months; I have done all the cooking
for my family all the year; the pain in my stomach disappeared; the yellow
discharge also&mdash;the bearing down banished. I have no pain, no aches, no bad
feelings. I feel better to day, than I have in ten years. I now enjoy life,
enjoy my family, enjoy my friends. I enjoy the pleasure of telling my
friends who cured me, and what medicine it was that cured me; he should
have the honor. It is Dr. Pierce!</p>

<p>I was at death's door when I began to take his medicine, and followed
his advice. It was his "Favorite Prescription," "Golden Medical Discovery"
and the "Pleasant Pellets" that cured me. I also used the lotion, or wash
advised, with a syringe.</p>

<p>Now, I wish you to accept my best wishes, and hearty thanks for what you
have done for me.</p>

<p>Last winter I gave my sick friends the pamphlets which were around the
bottles of medicine; some of them are going to take it; it gives great
satisfaction here; I will take no other myself; it will come the nearest to
raising the dead of any medicine I ever saw in my life; it saved my life,
when four doctors gave me up to die. My God bless you in your work, as He
has done in my case.</p>

The summer following my health was very bad; I then got one dozen bottles

affection of the spleen; had a great deal of headache; was costive, and

burning and itching; sometimes experienced severe burning in the stomach. I

I had pains through my chest and spit up blood. I commenced with your

felt like a different person. I took four bottles of the medicine and it
cured my cough. Have not been bothered since, until a short time ago I took
cold and commenced to cough again; I got a bottle of the "Discovery" and it
relieved me at once. I think it is the best medicine in the world. It saved
my life. I don't think any one would die of consumption if they would take

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I have used your "Favorite Prescription" and must
acknowledge to you and the public also, the benefits I received from the
use of a half dozen bottles of it. My condition was pitiful before I was
persuaded to use it. I had leucorrhea, no appetite, cold feet, weakness,
fainting spells, melancholy. I felt that I would soon leave my children
motherless. I fell off in flesh to a pitiful looking object. My friends
around said I must be consumptive. My family doctor gave me nearly all
kinds of blood medicine for over a year&mdash;all kinds of tonics to build up
flesh, but nothing seemed to benefit me.</p>

<p>Last September one year ago, I began using Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription, being convinced that my disease was female weakness. I had
only used it three days when I began to feel better and, after using three
bottles accompanied by the "Discovery," I felt as though I was well, and
continued its use until I had used half a dozen bottles for fear of a
relapse.</p>

<p>Was a living picture of surprise to my friends. They had all expected my
death. I have given birth two months ago to a baby and no return of my old
disease. I hope that all females, dragging about with pain and weakness,
dyspepsia, melancholy feelings, restlessness at night, and not feeling like
getting up in the morning, may commence the use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription, and be well again. Yours respectfully,</p>

with "Female Weakness" and leucorrhoea, when I took a severe cold which
settled on my lungs, and I had a very severe attack of asthma, which was so
bad that for three weeks I could not lie down in bed at all. I had a
terrible cough, in fact, every one thought I had consumption and nothing
gave me relief until I took your medicines, using two bottles of "Favorite
Prescription" and two of "Golden Medical Discovery." They cured me and I
have had no return of the dreadful cough since, and that has been two years
now and I have had good health ever since.</p>

relief. I grew worse with leucorrhea all the time until I chanced to see
your remedies.</p>

<p>I consulted you; you pronounced my trouble leucorrhea, and advised Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription. You sent me some prescriptions to have
filled here, which I used with great success. I am entirely free from my

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I was taken sick with the grip on the first day of
January, 1892. I employed a doctor, until in May I was some better, but
could not do any work. The Grip left me with a weakness, my head felt very
badly and I would get so discouraged and despondent. It affected my back,
hips, and legs, and made me miserable indeed. My stomach was very bad; it
soured and burned after eating. My heart, also, gave me much distress by
beating so fast and loud at times.</p>

<p>In May I commenced using Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription; took seven
bottles of that, and then, by your advice, began taking Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery. I took five bottles of that, making twelve bottles in
all.</p>

which did her a great deal of good.</p>

I was confined to my bed most of the time from May until September. I was

Dr. R.V. Pierce, of Buffalo. Through his good advice I began using his
"Favorite Prescription," having taken in all eight bottles of
"Prescription" and two of his "Golden Medical Discovery." I am at present
enjoying better health than I have for twelve years. As it is now three
years since I quit using those medicines and I have no return of my old
trouble. I consider myself permanently cured.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I had suffered so much for years from "Liver
Complaint" that I did not care whether I got well or not, but my husband
urged me to take your "Golden Medical Discovery." I had not had my courses
for six months; after I had taken your medicine about two months, I was
well.</p>

<p>When one of my daughters with a baby two weeks old was in so much pain
that she could not rest day or night, I went to her as quickly as I could,
and commenced giving her your "Favorite Prescription." The next morning the
pains were all gone. She said, "oh, mother, I would have died if you had
not come. I do feel so good." Your medicine makes people feel like they
wanted to live. There is a woman at Verdi who had several children who died
with consumption of the bowels and <i>chronic diarrhea</i>. She had another
one who was going the same way. The doctor said it was bound to die. I went
there and gave it five drops of Dr. Pierce's Extract of Smart-Weed, and
increased the dose every time its bowels moved, until I got to a half
teaspoonful. The next morning the child was almost well. That woman says I
saved her baby's life.</p>

<p>I could write a week and not tell half the good your medicines have done
through my hands. Two weeks ago, a young man at my house was taken with
<i>cholera morbus</i>. He thought he was surely going to die, but as
quickly as I could get some hot water, I put hot applications on his
stomach and bowels, and gave him a few doses of your Extract of Smart-Weed.
He got well immediately.</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>&mdash;Years ago you sent a box of medicine to my sister, Mrs.
Cynthia P. Freer in New Albion, N.Y., which did so much for her that after
I was married I used them in my own family. Two different times I have used
the "Discovery" when physicians told me they could only patch me up&mdash;I was
so bad and getting steadily worse. I sat down and wrote to you; even after
the letter was written I felt so worthless it seemed foolish to try, so
kept my letter for some time thinking it better not to trouble you with it,
but finally mailed it little thinking your advice and the "Discovery" could
so speedily restore me to my usual health.</p>

<p>A near neighbor used it for a cough occasioned by a sudden cold, and
less than one bottle stopped the cough. We use the "Pellets" for malaria
and the numberless ills and epidemics that go the rounds, always with happy
results; it saves us physicians' bills and much suffering. We consult your
Common Sense Medical Adviser as our family physician. It saves much anxiety
and fruitless journeyings after a physician, perhaps to find them gone or
unwilling to breast the storm or heat, to say nothing of the delay and
danger of being too late.</p>

<p>Both my sister and myself have used your "Favorite Prescription" and
know it to be what it is represented by you to be. I can conscientiously
recommend those of your remedies we have used. I am willing to answer

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>&mdash;I am enjoying good health, and I deem it my duty to
send you my testimonial. I can conscientiously recommend your medicines to
any suffering woman. I think they are indeed the best medicines for "female
complaint" that has ever been invented. Had it not been for them I surely
would have died.</p>

<p>I tried numbers of remedies from doctors but without getting any relief;
I then took Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and his "Favorite
Prescription" and I feel confident that I am permanently cured.</p>

<p>I told my mother to try it; she has taken four bottles&mdash;two of the
"Golden Medical Discovery" and two of the "Prescription." She says it is
the best medicine she has ever tried for her case; she is in better health
than she has been for fifteen years. Mrs. Shelton also used it, says it has
done her more good than all the doctors' medicine ever did; she has "female
complaint."</p>

The family physician was treating me for liver complaint. I did not get any
better under that treatment so I thought I would try Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription and "Golden Medical Discovery." I felt better before I used
one bottle of each. I continued their use until I took six bottles of each.
In three months' time I felt so well I did not think it necessary to take
any more. In childbirth it does what Dr. Pierce recommends it to do. I
would like to recommend Dr. Pierce's Extract of Smart-weed to those who
have never tried it; it surely is the best thing for cholera morbus, or
pain in the stomach I ever used; it <b>works</b> like a charm. I try never

<h4>"CHANGE OF LIFE," ORGANIC HEART DISEASE, WOMB TROUBLE.</h4>

<p>Dr. R.V. PIERCE, Buffalo, N.Y.:</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>&mdash;I feel that I would be doing an injustice to you and to
suffering humanity if I did not write you a statement of my case.</p>

<p>I have been a constant sufferer all my life, and for the past five years
have been under the care of many good physicians, who, I must say, have
only given me relief for a short time. I cannot describe the constant pain
and torment to which I was subjected every moment of my life, and I was so
reduced in flesh and strength that I could scarcely walk across the floor
and had little hope of ever being any better.</p>

<p>I was induced, by the advice of a friend, to take your "Favorite
Prescription," as she had been cured after taking several bottles of it. My
physicians said I was suffering from the effects of "change of life,"
organic heart disease and womb trouble.</p>

<p>I sent for your Common Sense Medical Adviser and then wrote to you. You
advised me to take six bottles more of the "Favorite Prescription," which I
did, and in a reasonable length of time after taking it, I felt very
grateful for the happy relief I obtained. I do not suffer near so much with
my heart as I did before taking the "Favorite Prescription." I had not been
able to do any kind of work at all for two years, and I am now able to
attend to my household duties without suffering any pain.</p>

<p>I have two daughters&mdash;17 and 19 years old, that have been in very bad
health for twelve months or more. I gave them each several bottles of the
"Favorite Prescription," and it entirely cured them.</p>

<p>I would send you my photo., as you request, but have none, and there is
no <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753"></a>[pg

could have one taken.</p>

<p>I now thank you most kindly for the happy relief and cure which myself
and daughters received from taking your "Favorite Prescription."</p>

<p>With many thanks and wishing you success, I am.</p>

down pain. I consulted a physician, who treated me for awhile till I began
to feel worse, and consulted another physician whom I knew had treated
several women for like ailments. He gave me medicine which did me no more
good than that prescribed by the first physician.</p>

<p>Finally, after an examination, the doctor said that he should have to
operate on me in order to have my health restored.</p>

<p>As my husband and I had heard and read so much about Dr. Pierce's
medicines we decided to try them. We had Dr. Pierce's Common Sense Medical
Adviser. I took three or four bottles of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription
and one bottle of "Golden Medical Discovery" and one vial of "Pellets."
After using these I felt perfectly cured. As I am always troubled more or
less with biliousness, I keep your little "Pellets" on hand and find relief
by using them. One of them taken after meals acts splendidly for
indigestion.</p>

sleep without that coughing and choking that, before the use of the
"Discovery," was impossible.</p>

<p>The tumor began to lessen in size, and after the third bottle I would

Sleeps as good as any child and is full of life. He does not take anything

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;In the winter of 1881, I became irregular in my
monthly courses. Of course at first I paid but little attention to it,
hoping it would amount to nothing and probably wear away. But I slowly but
surely grew worse, and at last resolved to apply to the doctors for help.
My water came often, and in small quantities, and with great pain, and with
red brick-dust deposit. I was attacked with severe womb trouble, bloody
piles and dropsy of the ovary. I was treated by five different doctors. I
was compelled to wear an inside support for a year, but it still seemed
impossible for me to get well and I began to feel exceedingly alarmed and
very uneasy, not knowing what course to pursue, or what the consequences
might be. I had heard of Dr. Pierce, and concluded to make one more trial,
so I sat down and wrote a letter to him, stating matters as near as I
could, and in due time I received a favorable reply; then I commenced with
his medicine. I commenced somewhere in February 1891 with the "Golden
Medical Discovery" and "Favorite Prescription," in alternate doses. A
strange occurrence followed. My limbs felt like what we call "asleep," and
I felt as if I were in a strange land and wondered what was going to take
place. I kept on till I took nine bottles. The first relief I felt was from

cured <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759"></a>[pg

years, and of dyspepsia of long standing. I was entirely cured of a very
singular and severe itching on my back, between my shoulders, which our
doctors called winter itch and which they pronounced incurable. I had
suffered with this for twenty years; it would come in the winter and go
away in the summer. I was also cured of the worst form of bloody piles and
of womb disease. At present I feel like a new person.</p>

<p>When I first commenced with Dr. Pierce's medicines, I could not walk

post-office, a distance of twelve miles, and the next day walked back
again, and felt no bad results from the journey. I am now 51 years old.</p>

temporary relief from medicines prescribed by them. I was advised by a

the breast. The doctors said they could do nothing for me any more and must
resort to the knife. I would not consent and so wrote to you, and followed
your advice. I took two dozen bottles of your 'Favorite Prescription,'
seven bottles of your 'Golden Medical Discovery' and my health is now
better than it had been in twenty years; my neighbors said I could not live

connected with very painful and irregular menstruation with chills during
the same. Rush of blood to the head, sometimes falling down in
insensibility and remaining so for several hours; and part of the time
could not bear my weight on my limbs to stand up or walk at all for several
days at a time. I was a burden to myself when I commenced taking Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription and "Golden Medical Discovery," and his
"Pleasant Pellets" and "Smart-weed;" I used the glycerine and iodine as you
prescribed for me also. I think I used one dozen bottles of "Prescription,"
half a dozen "Discovery" one dozen "Pills," one-half dozen "Smart-weed," at

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>&mdash;We received your kind letter, with the "Pellets," and
are very much obliged for the same. We know they are just what you
recommend them to be. We have used your medicines for about seven years and
have depended almost entirely on them for five years. Before we began the
use of your medicines, we used to have to employ a doctor every little
while; now we do not have to. We have four children. We give them Dr.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery when they take cold and I think it is far
better than most cough medicines, for the "Discovery" helps the appetite
and the cough medicines make one sick. I like your idea of keeping the
blood pure and the "Discovery" is the medicine for that. I take a bottle
twice a year, in the spring and fall, and I have recommended it to several
other ladies who have tried it and they all think highly of it. I have
bought thirteen bottles of the "Discovery" and three bottles of Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription and nine bottles of the "Pellets" in five
years, so you see our doctor-bill has not been very large. Our oldest boy
hurt himself, lifting, and I depended upon Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract of
Smart-weed for external application, and it cured him. I bought two bottles
of that.</p>

a great deal of good. I was sick for nearly three years. Sometimes I
thought I would go crazy I was so weak, nervous, and down hearted, and sour
in spirits, that I was afraid I would die every day, and such mean feelings
I could not describe to any one. I remained in this stage for nearly three
years, doctoring with every home doctor and trying every medicine that I
thought would help me, and I could get no relief. I could not sleep at
times and had palpitation of the heart so that I would have to get up, for
my heart would beat so fast I thought every minute I would die. The misery
I went through no one could describe.</p>

<p>A lady friend handed me Dr. Pierce's Common Sense Medical Adviser, and I
wrote to you about myself, and you told me to take "Favorite Prescription"
and "Golden Medical Discovery." I commenced in the spring and took three
bottles of each of your medicines, and I felt so much better I thought that
was enough, and ever since I have had my health. I grew stronger, and could
run and skip about like a child, and was happy all day long. I felt so well
I could hardly believe it was myself. I just used the two kinds of
medicines&mdash;"Golden Medical Discovery" and "Favorite Prescription," and
followed the "Common Sense Medical Adviser," took regular baths, and dieted
for about a year, and the result was a bright baby boy which brightens our
home. I took the "Favorite Prescription" before, and the result was a few
hours' labor and got along splendidly; my baby weighed twenty-four pounds
at seven months&mdash;a brighter, healthier baby than he is there never was.</p>

spells. My nerves were prostrated and I had female weakness and ulceration
of the womb, which caused such excessive flowing that they thought I would
die; then I would take sinking spells. My stomach was too weak, the
medicine could not do its part as it should have done. I had torpid liver
and right side of lungs affected; catarrh of the throat and piles;
palpitation of the heart, and kidneys were somewhat affected. My doctor got
me up and able to walk through the house, but the flowing would still be so
bad that I would have to take the bed; then would be able to be up again
and learn to walk a little again till the time would come again.</p>

<p>My doctor treated me for the ulcers. A lady came to see me. She told me
to try Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription. I got it but did not tell my
doctor. He soon remarked the improvement and I then told him what I was
using; he told me to use it, that it would be good for me. I used eleven
bottles of the "Favorite Prescription," and two of the "Golden Medical
Discovery." The flowing was not so bad. I got so I could sit up and be
about at all times, and walk about in the house. I am still improving, and
can do light house work. I am able to walk out to church every Sunday.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I am happy to say that your valuable medicine has been
a great benefit to me. I was suffering from general debility, malaria and
nervous sick headaches, and after my third child was born (a beautiful baby
boy of ten pounds) I only recovered after a long illness; I barely gained
strength enough in two years' time so that I was able to crawl about to
accomplish the little housework that I had, by lying down to read many
times each day; had sick headaches very often; and many pains and aches,
all the time complaining of getting no better. I finally asked my husband
to get a bottle of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, which he promptly
did. After I had taken one bottle I could see a great change in my
strength, and fewer sick headaches.</p>

<p>I continued taking the medicine until I had taken eight bottles&mdash;seven
of the "Favorite Prescription" and one of the "Golden Medical Discovery."
For some time past I have not used it but I am now able to do the housework
for myself, husband and two children (aged nine and five years). I also
take in dressmaking, and enjoy walking a mile at a time, and I think it is
all due to the medicine, for I know I was only failing fast before I
commenced to take it. I take great pleasure in recommending the "Favorite

used two or three bottles and thought I was cured, but it came back in
three or four months, and as soon as I began to take the medicine again I
got better. I took two or three bottles again, and never felt anything of
it since; and that is nearly four years ago, and I give all thanks to Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription. I use no other medicine at all for stomach
trouble but Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. I have been troubled
some with rheumatism, when nothing else would do any good, "Golden Medical
Discovery" cured me; I had not taken more than one-half bottle when I felt
like another woman, and I would advise any who has any trouble with his
stomach, or who has rheumatism, to try it as there is not its equal to be

very much improved in health, and says she feels as if she had a new lease
of life. She feels so much better since she commenced taking your medicine.
I think it was just the medicine she needed, and am more than thankful to
you for the kindly interest you have taken, and hope that others will find
the same benefit from your valuable books and medicines, that my sister
has. I will close with gratitude to you.</p>

<h4>HOW TRAVELING INVALIDS MAY BE IMPOSED UPON.</h4>

<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;It is now about five years since I spent eight days at
the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, under treatment for a chronic
disease of eighteen years' standing. I had given up to die. Going to your
Dispensary was a last resort with me; I had undergone a surgical operation
at the hands of my family physician from which I grew worse every day for
eight months, so that I very despondently started for your institution; and
when I had traveled eleven hundred miles I was made more despondent by
inquiring of a man how far I had to travel to reach Buffalo, N.Y.: He
answered, "Just one hundred miles." I then inquired of him if he had ever
been in Buffalo, N.Y. He replied, "Many a time." I then asked him, what
about Dr. Pierce's world-famed Surgical Institute? "Oh, it's a humbug. They
have some drawings or pictures taken from some government buildings, that's
where they get that fine building you see pictured in their books and
pamphlets."</p>

<p>I don't suppose there ever was a sadder heart entered the door of the
Invalids' <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768"></a>[pg
768]</span>Hotel than that heart of mine; but it was soon made glad to be
glad ever since. During the first night in the Invalids' Hotel I met and
talked with patients afflicted as I was. Many of them were cured and
talking of going home next day, and sure enough, they went; but I never
missed them in number for others kept coming.</p>

<p>I can honestly and truthfully say that the World's Dispensary Medical
Association of Buffalo, N.Y., is anything else than a humbug. The reason
why they are not humbugs is plain. They continue to perform wonderful cures
and treat their patients with unsurpassed nursing, and a kinder lot of
physicians, surgeons and nurses I don't believe can be found in the
world.</p>

<p>I cheerfully advise all persons suffering from chronic diseases not to
stop to count the distance from where they live to Buffalo, N.Y., but go
straight to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute without delay, for
it is by the will of God and their skill that I am living to-day.</p>

commenced using your medicine I was suffering from female weakness,
leucorrhea, bearing-down pains and a soreness across me that at times I
could hardly stand up straight when I would get up off of my chair to walk
across the room. I got a bottle of your "Favorite Prescription" and by the
time I had used half of it, the soreness began to get better. I used three
bottles altogether, and since that, you might say I am enjoying the best of
health most of the time. I have had two baby boys since&mdash;both healthy,
although the baby is only three weeks old, and I am doing all of my own
work since he was two and one-half weeks old.</p>

they give it a fair trial.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I take pleasure in adding my testimonial to the great

three doctors and none of them seemed to do me any good. When at last I
almost despaired of health any more, I saw in a paper one of your
advertisements, and I sent for and got two bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery, and I improved so rapidly that I sent for and got three
bottles of your "Favorite Prescription," and now I am as well as I have
been since I was a child.</p>

<p>I had been a sufferer for three years when I commenced taking Dr.
Pierce's medicines. When I commenced taking it, I was not able to walk
across my room without help, or rise from my chair. I suffered from
nervousness very much, and with the least excitement I would faint; and I
think, in short, I suffered with female irregularities and that your
medicine has brought me through. I don't think I can say enough for it. I
have used five bottles of your medicine in all.</p>

<h2>SPERMATORRHEA</h2>

<h3>(SEMINAL WEAKNESS),</h3>

<p>or emission of semen without copulation, is generally induced by the
early habit of masturbation. It is one of the evidences that passion,
instead of prudence, has held sway. Passion may aptly be termed the voice
of the body, by which, if we listen, we are enchanted and led astray.
Conscience is the voice of the soul, which remonstrates, and if we obey, we
shall be guided aright. We cannot reconcile these conflicting voices, and
if we indulge the passions when conscience forbids gratification, the
remembrance of the wrong remains forever, and constant fear is an
everlasting punishment.</p>

<p><b>Wrecked Manhood</b>. Man possesses few powers which are more highly
prized than those of virility, which is the very essence of manhood. "He is
but the counterfeit of a man, who hath not the life of a man."</p>

<p><b>The Semen</b> is a milky fluid of the consistency of mucus. It is
secreted by the testicles and is intermixed with the fluids secreted by the
prostate and by Cowper's glands. Its fertilizing property depends on the
presence of minute bodies, termed <i>spermatozoa</i>. These consist of
little polliwig-shaped bodies (Fig. 3), having large heads and long
filaments or tails. Under the microscope these little bodies are seen to
describe movements not unlike those of polliwigs.</p>

<p><b>Why Emissions of the Vital Fluid Debilitate</b>. The seminal fluid
consists of the most vital elements in the human body. It not only assists
in maintaining the life of the individual, but communicates the essential,
transforming principle which generates another mortal having an
imperishable existence. Its waste is a wanton expenditure, which robs the
blood of its richness and exhausts the body of its animating powers. No
wonder that its loss enfeebles the constitution, and results in impotency,
premature decline, St. Vitus's dance, paralysis, epilepsy, consumption,
softening of the brain, and insanity. No wonder that conscience and fear
become tormenting inquisitors, and that the symptoms are changed into
imaginary specters of stealthily approaching disease.</p>

<blockquote>
"There is no future pang<br />
Can deal that justice on the self-condemned<br />
He deals on his own soul."<br />
</blockquote>

<p><b>The Practice of Onanism</b> squanders the vitality and bankrupts the
constitution. Indigestion, innutrition, emaciation, shortness of breath,
palpitation, nervous debility, are all symptoms of this exhaustion.
Subsequently, the yellow skin reveals the bones, the sunken eyes are
surrounded by a leaden circle, the vivacious imagination becomes dull, the
active mind grows insipid&mdash;in short, the spring, or vital force, having
lost its tension, every function wanes in consequence. Excessive <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773"></a>[pg 773]</span>lustful
enjoyment produces feebleness, and finally terminates in disease and
impotency.</p>

<p><b>Seminal Weakness</b> may be the result of marital excesses. A
<i>proper</i> sexual gratification contributes to the health and happiness
of both parties. On the other hand, intemperate indulgence not only
prevents fruitfulness, but ultimately, if persisted in, renders the husband
entirely impotent, and undermines and destroys the constitution of the
wife. Spermatorrhea may be induced by spinal irritation, intestinal worms,
or piles. It may also result from inherited, as well as acquired,
constitutional weakness.</p>

<p><b>Nocturnal or Night Emissions</b>. Involuntary emissions of semen most
frequently occur during amorous dreams at night, and are therefore termed
<i>nocturnal emissions</i>. Although they are at first occasioned by
lascivious dreams, attended by erections and pleasurable sensations, yet,
as the disease progresses, the erections become less perfect and the losses
are only revealed by the depression of spirits experienced the following
morning, and by the stiffened and stained spots on the linen. At first,
these emissions may occur but once in two or three weeks, unless the
patient be excited by company, stimulation, food, drinks, or other causes;
but, at a later stage of the disease, they sometimes take place every
night. In aggravated cases, the seminal sacs are so weakened that the
warmth of the bed, friction of the clothing, reading obscene literature,
viewing indecent pictures, indulging in lewd conversation, or even being in
the presence of women, produces a waste of semen&mdash;many times unattended by
erections. When there is great weakness, seminal discharges may be induced
by lifting heavy weights, pressure upon the genital organs, horseback
riding, straining at stool, or even upon urinating, as observed when
muscular efforts are made to expel the last drops, which appear thick and
viscid. If the urine be allowed to stand for a few hours, the seminal
discharge will be precipitated, and will form a light-colored deposit at
the bottom of the vessel. If the sediment be examined with a microscope,
spermatozoa can readily be detected in it.</p>

<p><b>Wasting Away of the Testicles</b>. Masturbation not only occasions
loss of semen, but frequently the testicles and other generative organs
waste and become reduced in size as a result of the abuse. Fig. 1 shows the
testicle in a healthy condition, while Fig. 2 represents one much reduced,
as a result of self-abuse.</p>

<p>The celebrated Dr. Drewery, of London, speaking of the reason why
masturbation is so extremely injurious in its effects upon both body and
mind, says:</p>

<p>"This is a question which I have often been asked by patients, and it is
one which is rather difficult to explain to any one not acquainted with the
phenomena of reflex nervous action.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the simplest mode of putting it is to say that the effects
produced by the excitement of the parts are not the direct result of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774"></a>[pg 774]</span>the
stimulation, but that the excitement of the extremities of the nerves is
conveyed through them to the spinal cord and brain, and that the emission
which occurs, when sufficient stimulus has been applied, is the result of
nervous force reacting upon the parts from the spinal cord back again. This
action is termed reflex, and is similar to that of vomiting, which is only
produced through the medium of the great nervous centres; so that if the
nervous communication between the stomach and spinal cord and brain is cut
off, nothing in the stomach could possibly cause vomiting, whereas if the
communication remains intact, this action can be immediately produced by
irritation of nerves far away from the stomach, viz., by tickling the
fauces, as every drunkard is well aware who has ever put his finger down
his throat for the purpose of emptying his stomach of the contents which
are poisoning him, but which without the additional stimulus he is unable
to expel. It will be seen, therefore, from this that the act of emission is
only produced through the agency of the spinal cord, and not by any direct
nervous action between the parts which are stimulated, and those which are
concerned in the emission.</p>

/></a><br />Fig. 2. A Testicle wasted by Masturbation.</p>

<p>"The brain is also concerned to the fullest extent in the production of
these phenomena, as are all the senses of the body; this is proved by the
fact that emissions occur during sleep, without any excitement <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_775" id="Page_775"></a>[pg 775]</span>beyond
the engorgement of the parts with blood, produced by the cerebellar
congestion of the brain, usually found to follow lying upon the back during
sleep. This, however, is unnatural and unhealthy, and is usually the
result, as before pointed out, of masturbation. But these two important
points must be remembered&mdash;that emission may be produced by friction merely
as a purely spinal reflex action, and it may be caused by the action of the
brain without any friction whatever. Both these results are unhealthy and
injurious. A true natural and healthy act of sexual intercourse demands the
excitement of brain, spinal cord, and every nerve in the body
simultaneously, and resembles the lightning flash which restores the
equilibrium of electric force disturbed during a thunderstorm.</p>

<p>"It is useless to endeavor to describe the marvelous actions of nervous
force, but from what has been said it is not difficult to comprehend that
if a convulsive action is produced in any part of the body by the sole
excitement of the spinal cord, when it is necessary for its healthy and
natural production that the brain and senses generally should be equally
excited, the balance of nerve power is destroyed, which fact alone is
proved by the effects upon the nervous system always following
masturbation, which is the irritation of the spinal cord without the
assistance of the brain."</p>

<p><b>Various Complications</b> are likely to arise in the progress of this
malady.</p>

<p><b>Stricture</b> of <b>the Urethra</b>, or water passage, is a very
common complication and, even when quite slight, generally interferes very
seriously with the cure of the spermatorrhea when overlooked by the
attending physician, as is very commonly done, especially when the
constriction of the water passage is only slight. Very often it occurs in
our practice that on examining a case of this disease that has been the
rounds of the doctors, we find a stricture, which had been entirely
overlooked by other practitioners, being so slight as not to occasion
serious obstruction to the flow of urine but yet sufficient to interfere
very much with the cure of the spermatorrhea. The size of the urethra, or
water passage, should bear an exact and proportionate relation to that of
the penis, and when from any cause the urethra is contracted below this
normal size, it should receive attention, as otherwise the stricture is
likely to increase and the passage becomes so constricted as to produce
serious disease of the bladder, and not fail to perpetuate spermatorrhea,
when this disease exists.</p>

<p><b>Hydrocele</b> (<i>Dropsy of the Scrotum</i>) consists of an undue
secretion of the fluid which moistens the <i>tunica vaginalis</i>, and may
arise from an irritation of the testicle, produced by masturbation. This
subject is fully considered in the Medical Adviser.</p>

<p><b>Varicocele</b> is a dilatation of the veins of the spermatic cord and
scrotum, and is frequently a result of masturbation. It is readily
distinguished under the form of a soft, doughy, compressible, knotty, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776"></a>[pg 776]</span>and
unequal enlargement of the veins, and a tumid condition of the adjacent
parts. One writer, speaking of the enlargement of the spermatic vessels,
describes them as "feeling like a coiled up bundle of worms."</p>

<p><b>Disease of the Prostate Gland</b> is frequently caused by solitary
indulgence. Venereal excesses produce congestion and the gland is
overnourished. It becomes greatly enlarged, a condition called
<i>hypertrophy</i>. This affection gives rise to a heavy feeling or
pressure in the region below the bladder, and often interferes seriously
with urination, and gives great pain and uneasiness, and often results in
grave and dangerous complications.</p>

<p><b>Prostatorrhea</b> consists of an unnatural flowing or wasting of the
prostatic secretion, which may be known by its mucous-like appearance, and,
when placed within the field of the microscope, by the absence of
<i>spermatozoa</i> or fecundating germs. It is often mistaken for
spermatorrhea, or for gleet, by inexperienced and careless physicians. For
a full consideration of diseases of the prostate gland, see Part IX of our
Dime Series of pamphlets, which will be sent on receipt of ten cents in
postage stamps.</p>

<p>Again, the habit of self-pollution weakens all the structures of the
genital organs, and induces seminal waste, which may lead to a morbid
diminution in the size of the prostate gland. This condition, which is
exactly the opposite of the one above described, is <i>atrophy</i>. Any
disease which renders the circulation in the prostate gland languid and
feeble interferes with the nutrition of that organ and impairs its
function.</p>

<p><b>Impotency</b> (<i>Loss of Sexual Power</i>). Masturbation prevents
the excitability of the nervous system and sexual organs and causes
debility, which is indicated by the premature discharge of semen during
sexual intercourse. These premature emissions indicate not only partial
impotency, but also that the nerve-centres have become morbidly sensitive
by the practice of solitary vice, or marital excesses. At length the powers
of the erectile tissues are diminished, and there is weakness which
prevents the act of copulation, or the erection may be slow and not last
long enough, on account of a faulty functional condition of the spinal
cord.</p>

<p><b>A Peculiar Form of Impotency</b> is associated with certain abnormal
nutritive changes which give rise to a lymphatic or fat condition of the
system. Not that the temperament in all these cases is originally
lymphatic, but the system degenerates in consequence of nutritive
perversion. With the loss of sexual ardor, there is also apathy of mind,
loss of manliness, and the victim becomes cold, dispassionate, and
treacherous, devoid of any admiration or love for the opposite sex. He
acquires rotundity of person, the face is fat, smooth, often beardless, and
the voice is feminine.</p>

<p>The victims of this disease represent two distinct classes, viz.: (1)
those who are fearfully tormented by the consciousness that they <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777"></a>[pg 777]</span>are
losing their virile powers, and become irritable, jealous and often
desperate; and (2) those who are completely indifferent to this
deprivation.</p>

<p>(1.) Patients of the former class are readily restored to health by
proper treatment, for they are willing to make an effort for the recovery
of their manly powers. There is not complete loss of sexual desire, yet
their disappointment is so great that they may entertain suicidal thoughts.
They are moody, fickle, discontented, excitable, and remarkably impulsive.
With proper treatment, they regain tone of body, vigor of mind, an increase
of sexual desire, and become more attentive to business affairs, and less
indifferent to the gentler sex. With the restoration of the general health
and the sexual functions, remarkable constitutional changes occur. It is
often the case that their intimate friends hardly recognize them by looks
or acts.</p>

<p>(2.) It is equally true that those who are wholly indifferent to the
loss of virile power, uninterested in the evidences of their manhood, are
sometimes incurable. In fact, it is useless to treat the latter class,
because they will neither co-operate with the physician, nor persist in the
treatment necessary to effect a radical and constitutional change.</p>

<p>Masturbation perverts and finally destroys the secretory functions of
the testicles. It sometimes causes chronic inflammation, which may result
in obliteration of the minute seminal canals, or obstruction of the
conveying ducts. The sperm is imperfectly elaborated and totally unfit for
procreative purposes. Sometimes the spermatozoa are entirely absent, and,
when present, are very few in number, incomplete in structure, diseased,
and deficient in power as well as in organization. Fig. 3 represents the
spermatozoa in a healthy condition, and Fig. 4, when they are sickly,
deficient and inanimate. The husband may appear to be healthy, and
<i>his</i> inability to procreate may be erroneously considered a defect in
his wife.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms of Spermatorrhea</b>. The indications of abuse of the sexual
organs are loss of nervous energy, dullness of the mental faculties, and
delight in obscene stories. The expression of the face becomes coarse, and
the movements slow; the eye is sunken, the face bloated and pale, and the
disposition is fretful and irritable; the appetite is capricious, the
throat irritated, and the patient makes frequent attempts to clear it, in
order to speak distinctly. There are pains in the chest, wakefulness, and
during the night lascivious thoughts and desires. The relish for play or
labor is gone, and a growing distaste for business is apparent; there is a
determination of blood to the head, headache, noises and roaring sounds in
the ears, the eyes may be blood-shot and watery, weak or painful, the
patient imagines bright spots or flashes passing before them, and there may
be partial blindness. There is increasing stolidity of expression, the eye
is without sparkle, and the face becomes blotched and animal-like in its
expression. The victim is careless of his personal appearance, not <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778"></a>[pg
778]</span>unscrupulously neat, and not unfrequently a rank odor exhales
from the body.</p>

<p>There are troublesome sensations, as of itching and crawling, in and
about the scrotum. Subsequently, there is obstinate constipation, and all
the symptoms of dyspepsia follow. Gradually the pallor deepens, the patient
becomes emaciated. There is a shortness of breath, palpitation after even
moderate exercise, trembling of the knees, and eruptions on the skin. There
may also be cough, hoarseness, stitch in the side, loss of voice. The sleep
is not refreshing, the patient has frequent nightmare, or the dreams are
lascivious, and the involuntary emissions of semen become more frequent.
The weakness increasing, the sufferer experiences a weakness in his legs
and staggers like a drunken man, his hands tremble and he stammers.</p>

<p>The victim is unable to concentrate his thoughts, cannot remember what
he reads, and is mentally indolent. He begins to be suspicious of his
friends, has less confidence in others, and desires to be alone, is
despondent and has suicidal thoughts. He has pain in the back, does not
like to walk, and is inclined to lie down. The semen is prematurely
discharged upon attempting coition, and if there be offspring, it is apt to
be feeble or subject to scrofula, consumption, or convulsions. The genital
organs, especially the penis and testicles, diminish in size, as the
disease progresses, lose their energy, and the glands of the penis become
cold and flaccid. There is frequent desire to urinate, chronic irritation
in the neck of the bladder, and pain in the spermatic cord and testicle,
and sometimes in the end of the penis. The microscope shows that semen
involuntarily discharged may be devoid of spermatozoa, or if present, they
are defective, their heads being without tails. The urine is loaded with
mucus or bears up a filmy, membranous, transparent matter, or it may be
covered with a thin fluid having an oily appearance, but in rare cases is
clear. Again, it may <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779"
id="Page_779"></a>[pg 779]</span>hold substances in solution, which are
deposited in crystals or incrust the urine, or it may precipitate a
material having the appearance of brick-dust, and sometimes semen tinged
with blood. The dyspeptic symptoms when present are followed by diarrhea.
The limbs are cramped and rigid, the feet bloated, and the patient becomes
melancholy and relinquishes all hope of recovery. As the disease
progresses, the patient lacks firmness and is absent-minded.</p>

<p>When the erections are imperfect and the semen is prematurely
discharged, or when a lengthy coition is required before the sperm can be
ejected, it is evident that the patient is rapidly becoming impotent; the
virile powers are vanishing and manhood is surrendering sway to a merciless
foe. We frequently witness this condition in men, even at the age of
thirty-five, when the summit of vigor and strength should only have been
reached. How often are we solicited to restore these lost hopes and powers!
To what tales of ignorance and recklessness, or submission and remorse, do
we repeatedly listen from these unfortunate sufferers! In patients of this
class, sexual intercourse prevents spontaneous emissions, but it does not
remove the functional and organic derangements of the nerve-centres; hence,
at a time when the victims of this disease should be in the prime of life,
they are impotent, and epilepsy, apoplexy, paralysis, softening of the
brain, or insanity, frequently results.</p>

<p><b>Epilepsy</b> (OR FITS). This dread disease is one of the most common
and serious complications of the more advanced stages of spermatorrhea. The
injury done to the nerve-centres by the practice of masturbation is
manifested in epileptic convulsions, more or less frequent. If proper
treatment be early adopted, and faithfully pursued, the case is not yet
hopeless; though, in the majority of cases, the patient never recovers
after the disease assumes this phase.</p>

<p><b>Paralysis</b>. Paralysis, or Palsy, when occurring as a complication
of spermatorrhea, may be preceded by an attack of apoplexy, in which the
patient loses consciousness, and lays in a condition of profound stupor for
a time, and on recovery from his unconscious state, finds himself unable to
use one or more of his limbs, or the disability and loss of power, which
may also be accompanied by more or less loss of sensation, may come on
gradually, without any premonition or marked manifestation of its approach.
In either case, its appearance is to be regarded as a matter of serious
importance. Paralysis, when occurring as a consequence of masturbation or
sexual excesses, is usually difficult of cure; yet, now and then, cases are
cured at our Institutions even after this grave malady has appeared as a
complication.</p>

<p><b>Softening of the Brain</b>. This malady, although less common as a
result of masturbation than the complications mentioned in the preceding
paragraphs, is of sufficiently frequent occurrence to entitle it to a
passing notice here. This condition usually results ultimately in complete
dementia, or loss of reason. It is an incurable disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_780" id="Page_780"></a>[pg
780]</span><b>Insanity</b>. This deplorable malady is not a very uncommon
result of masturbation and its various resultant morbid conditions, as the
records of the many institutions for the unfortunate class of sufferers
from this disease bear abundant witness. Sometimes it manifests itself in
the milder forms of hallucination, or monomania, but in the majority of
cases, the patient sinks into a despondent hypochondria, which is many
times followed, sooner or later, by a raving mania.</p>

<p>In cases of monomania resulting from masturbation, the mental
derangement is often so slight as to escape detection by the patient's
friends, the peculiar freaks of disposition being regarded rather as
eccentricities of character than as symptoms of serious disease. Fits of
despondency are usually common with such sufferers. The mental derangement
is not always accompanied or preceded by spermatorrhea or frequent seminal
emissions, the injury done to the nervous system by the practice of
self-abuse, or sexual excesses, being first noticeable in various phantasms
or imaginings on the part of the patient. These are, in different cases, so
various, both in character and degree, as not to admit of any
classification, each case presenting phases peculiar to itself. In many
cases, the patient imagines that his best friends are conspiring to injure
him, or that some great calamity is about to befall him. In most cases
there is danger of the patient's committing suicide, if not closely
watched. Especially is this true of those who suffer from fits of
hypochondria.</p>

<p>Except in its milder forms, insanity resulting from masturbation and
sexual excesses, is rarely curable.</p>

<p><b>Don't be Alarmed.</b> A nocturnal seminal emission now and then, or
at long intervals is not, in and of itself, evidence of the existence of
spermatorrhea or other serious disease. A full blooded, strong, passionate
man, in vigorous health, and who has never abused himself, may now and
then, at long intervals, if his sexual passions be not gratified naturally,
or if he permit his mind to run much upon lascivious subjects, experience
an emission while asleep and dreaming. As to whether such occurrences are
evidence of disease or not, in any given case, depends upon their
frequency, and as to whether they are the result of a weakness of the
organs and are followed by more or less depression and debility, or are
merely the overflow of a robust system, or the outburst of restrained,
pent-up, and ungratified passions. In the latter case, and when only
occurring at long intervals, the emissions are not followed by any
perceptible enervating or weakening effects.</p>

<p><b>Quackery Rampant</b>. This country is flooded with cheap circulars
and pamphlets, circulated openly and broadcast, wherein ignorant,
pretentious, blatant quacks endeavor to frighten young men who may never
have practiced self-abuse, or been guilty of excesses in any way, and yet
who experience, now and then at long intervals, nocturnal seminal
emissions. In such cases, it is the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_781" id="Page_781"></a>[pg 781]</span>duty of the conscientious,
honest, and sympathetic practitioner of the healing art to give assurance,
and not to unnecessarily alarm those who experience nothing inconsistent
with a state of fairly good health. To frighten such young men into
believing themselves diseased, when in reality they experience nothing but
what may occasionally occur in the experiences of any robust, healthy man,
is the most detestable, downright quackery.</p>

<p><b>Treating the Wrong Disease.</b> Not only are many men subjected to
useless treatment by general practitioners who overlook the real disease,
caused by pernicious youthful habits pursued in solitude, or later excesses
in venery, but the female sex are also quite as often subjected to
treatment for diseases which do not exist, the real trouble being nervous
debility and other weaknesses that have resulted from the youthful
pernicious practices common to both sexes, or later excesses in marital
pleasures.</p>

<p><b>Moral Considerations</b>. Masturbation is a habit which tyrannizes
over the mind, perverts the imagination, and forces upon the victim
venereal desires, even while he is forming the strongest resolutions to
reform. It constrains into its service the higher faculties, such as
friendship, confidence, love, reason, and imagination, to make its ideal
graceful and beautiful.</p>

<p><b>Sensual Lust</b>. The fancy creates an attractive partner, possessed
of girlish beauty, a perfect type of goodness, blended with sexuality, and
whom the subject worships with all the ardor of passion. Around this
<i>beau ideal</i> all his affections are clustered; to her the purest of
his blood is offered in sacrifice, and it is no wonder that female
associates seem tame and unattractive when such imaginary and consummate
divinity is courted. In the sensual delirium is conceived an elysium of
carnal bliss, where half-nude nymphs display their charms and invite to
sensual enjoyments. Thus we see how this habit makes the spiritual
faculties subservient to morbid passion, and by what means elevating
influences are prostituted to vulgar and base-born creations.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms Vary in Different Cases</b>. We can only partially delineate
the terrible effects resulting from the abuse of the sexual organs. The
symptoms are multitudinous, but, as we have before stated, no two persons
are similarly influenced by this disease. The symptoms will vary according
to the severity of the affection, the age of the patient, and his
constitutional peculiarities. The presence of only a few of the symptoms
which we have enumerated is evidence of abnormal weakness, which demands
treatment.</p>

<p>Montaigne says: "We must see and get acquainted with our sins if we
expect to correct them." Virtue presupposes trials just as much as victory
implies warfare. The triumph of virtue is to defeat morbid or excessive
passion, for virtue is only realized when it is a conquering force.
Innocence is passive but virtue is an active quality, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_782" id="Page_782"></a>[pg
782]</span>purified in the fiery furnace of temptation. As men have in all
ages been influenced by passions, so temptation has ever found its victims.
It is an obligation that one owes to himself to overcome every evil passion
or weakness to which he is subject, and the discharge of this personal duty
requires moral courage.</p>

<p><b>The Reward of Virtue</b>. Our Saviour invited all erring mortals to
enter upon a higher life when He said, "Come unto Me, all ye that labor and
are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." The invitation is accompanied
with a promise. To all who are weary of excess and bowed down by passion,
rest and restoration are promised, if they will but reform and employ
proper means to that end.</p>

<p><b>The Sufferers Must Reform</b>. Just as there is no spiritual
restoration without obeying the Saviour, so there can be no physical
restoration unless we fulfill nature's imposed conditions. There can be no
salvation unless sin be discarded, and so there can be no redemption from
the bad effects of a practice, so long as it is continued. It is no easy
task to master a despotic passion. Appetite is often stronger than the
will. The treatment must begin with moral reformation. Every manly impulse,
and all the higher qualities of the patient's nature, must be enlisted in
the struggle for virtue and health.</p>

<p>If the passions are restrained, then the capital of health increases,
for the saving of the vital secretions is equal to compound interest. This
illustrates the truth of the Latin proverb: "<i>No gain is so certain as
that which proceeds from the economical use of what you have"!</i> The
patient actually acquires confidence and manly courage by the retention of
the seminal fluid, which directly increases his virile powers.</p>

<p><b>Hygienic Advice to Patients</b>. Daily physical exercise and regular
habits must be established. It is important that the mind, as well as the
physical powers, be directed into active and wholesome channels. There must
be restraint and discipline. It is useless to begin medical treatment while
the patient continues to read exciting, amorous stories and obscene books,
which are suggestive of lewd thoughts. Something practical ought to occupy
the thoughts and engage the hands.</p>

<p>Regular and vigorous physical exercise is necessary to assist the
circulation of the blood, and compel its determination into the minute and
extreme parts of the vascular system. When the blood is thus directed,
nutrition is more vigorous and the activity of all the functions is
augmented.</p>

<p>Not only should there be regularity in eating, but sound discretion
should be exercised in selecting a plain, wholesome diet, consisting of
such articles of food as best favor a daily and free evacuation of the
bowels. Avoid the use of those articles of food which produce excessive
acidity of the stomach. Hearty or late suppers are not allowable. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783"></a>[pg 783]</span>The
patient should use no alcoholic beverages, and should abstain from such
stimulants as tea, coffee, beer, wine, and tobacco. We cannot even
recommend their <i>moderate</i> use, for total abstinence is the better
plan.</p>

<p>The patient should sleep in a well-ventilated room, on a hard bed, and
have only sufficient covering for warmth and comfort. He should not lie
upon the back, because in this position nightly emissions are more likely
to occur. The patient should go to bed when he feels sleepy, and not resist
the inclination until wakefulness is induced.</p>

<p>He should rise early in the morning and immediately take a cold hand
bath. For this purpose a quart or two of water and a common hand towel only
are required. After bathing, rub the surface of the body with the dry hand
or a crash towel, and continue the friction until the skin is red and a
reaction is established. Do not excuse yourself from following these
hygienic suggestions. A refreshing bath changes the morbid sensibilities to
a more healthful state by the reaction of the nervous system.</p>

<p>It is beneficial to apply a towel saturated with cold water to the
genital organs fifteen minutes before leaving the bed. Douching, or
showering the genital organs with cold water once or twice a day will also
be beneficial. It should not be practiced, however, just before going to
bed. It is well to bathe the head with cold water, and this can be done
much better if the hair be kept closely cut.</p>

<p>Horseback riding, climbing, and all exercises which rub, chafe, or
excite the genital organs, should be avoided. Even the clothing should be
loose, so that walking will not produce friction or cause any excitement of
these organs. The calls of nature should receive prompt attention, and the
urine be voided at any time (especially during the night) when there is an
inclination. If there be irritation of the bladder and lower bowels, the
patient will receive decided benefit from the daily use of an injection of
cold water into the bowels. From a half pint to a pint of cold water may be
used at one time, and the injection should be retained for a few minutes
before going to bed. The bowels will thus be relieved, the heat and
irritation subdued, and the liability to seminal emissions lessened.</p>

<p>Patients afflicted with spermatorrhea should not allow their thoughts to
dwell upon their ailments, for they are apt to become moody, self-deceived,
and even insane upon this subject. To avoid this, harmless amusements
should be indulged in, and good moral company cultivated. They become
suspicious, skeptical, and believe that they are victims of imposture. When
they lose self-reliance, their faith and trust in others begins to waver,
especially if their health does not improve so rapidly as they had
anticipated: As much depends upon the faithful observance of the hygienic
rules as upon the constant and proper use of medicines. The rapidity of
recovery depends upon the constitutional energies and the vigor of the
vital resources. If the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784"
id="Page_784"></a>[pg 784]</span>blood be greatly impoverished, or the
nervous system much impaired, recovery will be necessarily slow. Time,
patience, and perseverance, are just as essential to a recovery from the
effects of these abuses as the best medical treatment that can be
employed.</p>

<p><b>The Medical Treatment of Spermatorrhea and Impotency.</b> Few
diseases require so many modifications of treatment, to suit the
peculiarities of individual cases as spermatorrhea, because it is attended
with so many complications and morbid functional and structural changes.
Every complication must be considered, and great judgment exercised in the
selection of remedies. As this selection must depend upon the peculiarities
of the case involved, it is impossible to impart to the non-professional
readers sufficient medical knowledge to enable them to choose the
appropriate remedies for these intricate disorders. Hence it would be
useless to specify the various medicines which our specialists employ in
treating them. It would only lead to many fruitless experiments, which
might result in great harm to the afflicted. For remedies powerful enough
to effect cures of spermatorrhea and impotency are capable, when improperly
employed, of doing great harm. Especially should all ready-made,
proprietary or put-up medicines, such as are sold in drug stores and
chemists' shops, be avoided, for reasons already mentioned. Great harm,
also, often results from the employment of "galvanic belts," "galvanic
batteries and pads," and other catch-penny devices, with which the too
confiding are not only duped and swindled, but terribly injured. They are
all worse than useless, and often render the mildest case very difficult to
cure by inducing serious complications. It is better to take no medical
treatment, but rely solely on the hygienic advice we have given, rather
than to resort to any of the so-called "<i>specifics"</i> found in the drug
shops, or to any such silly, good-for-nothing trash as the various
"Pastilles," "Boluses," "Curative Rings," "Voltaic Belts," or other
quackish medicines and contrivances.</p>

<p><b>Importance of Hygienic Discipline</b>. The invalid should restrict
his attention to hygiene, and learn that patient endurance and heroic
perseverance are necessary, even when taking the most efficient remedies.
His entire system having gradually become deranged, corrective medicines
must necessarily be <i>chronic</i> in their operations; in other words,
they must act insensibly, slowly, and progressively. Some of the symptoms
of sexual weakness will, under proper hygienic and medical treatment,
generally begin to disappear within a month. If the nervous system be very
much impaired, however, a longer time will elapse before the restorative
effects of treatment will be observed. Neither the physician nor the
patient should expect that a broken-down constitution can be immediately
repaired. The day of miracles is past. The most rational method of treating
the sick promises nothing supernatural, nothing <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_785" id="Page_785"></a>[pg 785]</span>which is not in accordance
with science. Diseases of this character are always slow in their
inception, or development and progress, and must be cured in like manner,
step by step. Nature never hurries; atom by atom, little by little, she
achieves her work.</p>

<p><b>Our Improved Treatment</b>. Tears ago our specialists resolved to pay
particular attention to the investigation and treatment of these diseases,
which are not only alarmingly prevalent, but sadly neglected and mistreated
by the general practitioner of medicine.</p>

<p><b>Unfailing Remedies</b>. Having successfully treated many thousands of
cases, we can safely say of our remedies that they are very positive in
their remedial effects. The great success which has attended the employment
of these remedies has led us to rely upon them with implicit faith. By
their persistent use, spermatorrhea and threatened impotency can be cured
as readily as other chronic or lingering diseases. We particularly solicit
those cases which have heretofore been regarded as incurable. The patient
is subjected to no surgical operation, and he can safely and accurately
follow the directions given, while the treatment does not interfere with
any ordinary occupation in which he may be engaged. These delicate diseases
should not be intrusted to physicians who advertise under fictitious names,
or to those of ordinary qualifications. The general practitioner may be
thoroughly read in these diseases, but he cannot acquire the skill of a
specialist who annually treats thousands of cases, while the former seldom,
if ever, has occasion to prescribe for them.</p>

<p><b>Signs of Improvement When Under Treatment.</b> Under our peculiar and
improved system of treatment, gradual improvement in the patient's
condition will be manifested. The eye becomes more brilliant and sparkling,
the patient is less morose, his digestion improves, he is less listless and
despondent, takes more interest in business and other affairs, his sleep is
less disturbed and more refreshing, the strength improves, and, if the
sexual organs had become wasted in size, weak in function, and flaccid and
soft, they begin, by and by, to have more tone and firmness, and to
develope and increase in size, as their nutrition is restored, by the
checking of the exhausting drain which they have sustained. If nocturnal
emissions occur occasionally, the discharge will, under the microscope, be
found to be less watery, and to contain increased numbers of
<i>spermatozoa</i>, with heads and filaments perfect. The patient now
begins to gain in self-confidence, courage, and other manly attributes,
and, instead of the bashful, retiring, nervous, languid hypochondriac, we
see a man of ambition and energy, competent to battle with the adversities
of life. Who can estimate the value of such a transformation from
nervousness and despondency to vigorous manhood? Who would begrudge all
their earthly goods and treasures when thus afflicted, to be so restored to
health and enjoyment for of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786"
id="Page_786"></a>[pg 786]</span>what avail are the greatest riches when
health and manhood itself are lost?</p>

<p><b>Our Terms Business-like and Fair</b>. Occasionally persona solicit us
to undertake the cure of these ailments, and, in case of failure, receive
no compensation. They write: "If you will <i>warrant</i> that your
prescriptions will result in a <i>perfect restoration to health</i>, we
will gladly pay the fees that you ask." The absurdity of such a request is
apparent, and therefore we answer: "We cannot <i>warrant</i> that you will
live even for the next twenty-four hours. We do not bet, play for stakes,
or wager our skill for money. Personal responsibility cannot be shifted or
evaded, and life and health, with all their momentous considerations, are
necessarily individual affairs. Therefore a proposal to make the conditions
of health a subject of speculation is a challenge to gamble." The patient
may not comply with the specified conditions, and the physician's success
depends upon a faithful application of the prescribed treatment. For these
reasons only a quack will be a party to any such transaction. Ours is not a
trading, hazardously speculative profession. Besides, thousands of our
patients reside long distances away and we cannot know of their
responsibility or honesty, nor spend time inquiring after their financial
standing.</p>

<p><b>Evidences of the Curability of Spermatorrhea and Impotency.</b> Many
individuals afflicted with spermatorrhea and impotency, particularly those
who have been swindled by some of the many charlatans who are to be found
in nearly every city, are incredulous, and doubt our ability to cure these
maladies. Others are skeptical, because their physician, who may be a very
skillful general practitioner, but who has had very little or no experience
in treating these delicate maladies, has failed to relieve them, and,
perhaps, has told them the disease is incurable.</p>

<p>We therefore beg the indulgence of our readers for here offering some
indisputable evidence of the extraordinary success which we have achieved,
by our peculiar methods of treating these affections, as pursued at the
World's Dispensary and Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.</p>

<p>This evidence is introduced for the encouragement of an unfortunate
class of invalids, for many of whom existence has ceased to possess any
charms. The grateful manifestations which we have received from this class
of sufferers have afforded us one of the greatest pleasures of our lives,
and have alone been a rich remuneration for the diligent study and arduous
labors devoted to the investigation of these diseases and to the perfecting
of our peculiar and successful methods of treating them.</p>

<p><b>Sacredly Confidential</b>. In introducing the following extracts from
our extensive files of letters, the names of the writers will be omitted,
as we regard all such correspondence, as well as facts communicated to us
in personal consultations, as <i>sacredly confidential.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787"></a>[pg
787]</span>Lack of space and fear of wearying the reader, prevent us from
introducing more than a few extracts; but these are only fair samples of
<i>thousands</i> that have been received. Those given, present cases in
almost every stage of treatment, some soon after commencing, others further
advanced, and still others which are cured. If we could devote the space,
and had we time to select them, we could insert an almost unlimited number
of those received from patients who have been perfectly cured; but we think
the reader will be more interested in expressions coming from patients in
all stages of treatment, as they are daily received. Therefore, without
regard for literary excellence, we append a number chosen miscellaneously,
and given <i>verbatim</i>. They express the sentiments of persons in all
stages of life, and illustrate the views and feelings generally entertained
by those whom we have been called upon to treat.</p>

<p>The following extracts are spontaneous acknowledgments, and are,
therefore, more valuable and truthful than if obtained by solicitation, a
practice contrary to our sense of propriety, and, hence, one in which we
never indulge. Although ofttimes less expressive of satisfaction and
gratitude than if the communication were presented in full, yet only
sufficient space can be spared for a brief quotation from each letter.</p>

<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: <i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;Since I have
taken the remainder of a third month's treatment that you gave me I have
been relieved of my trouble. The emissions have ceased and the losses at

<p><b>CASE 177,068. Spermatorrhea. Loss of vital strength. Cared with seven

<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: <i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;You have
undoubtedly wondered at my long silence. Since last I wrote you there has
been a marked change in my life (of which I will speak further on), under
your skillful treatment. I improved so rapidly, notwithstanding the many
interruptions which misfortune on my part occasioned, that six months ago I
considered myself cured. I have been married three months and a half to a
worthy woman, who should have gained for herself a husband who never
deviated from a virtuous path as much as I; but the attachment formed was
so strong that no misfortune seemed powerful enough to sever it. The
barrier which seemed insurmountable, and which I had erected myself by
early indiscretions and excesses, has given way, thanks to your superior
medical knowledge and skillful treatment. Again I can hold up my head and
say, "I am a man. I never fail to call the attention of my friends to your
Institution as the best in the world, for I have reason to know that it is
truly so. I have recommended two friends of mine to you, who are under your
treatment, and are getting well. One has tried all the local physicians,
and many firms, but with no success. May God bless you, and may your
Institution meet with all the success it so richly deserves, is the prayer
and wish of one you have caved. J., Leadville, Colo.</p>

<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: <i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I have had no
emissions now for some time, and feel well in every way. I am gaining in
strength and weight, and find I shall not need further medical treatment.
The four months' medicines that you have sent me have effected a radical

from the urethra, and a burning sensation in the testicle and groin.</p>

<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:
<i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I took the two months' treatment sent me by you as
directed. After taking the first month's treatment the emissions ceased
entirely, my appetite increased, and I slept much better. Eight months ago
I finished the second month's treatment and have since been in perfect
health. I am fully convinced that you do every thing that you promise. I
am, gentlemen, yours respectfully,</p>

<p><b>CASE 266,080. Spermatorrhea. Threatened Impotency. A severe case,
cured by six months' treatment.</b></p>

<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: <i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I have
received the last medicine sent me, and have taken all with the best
results. I have so improved in health that I think it unnecessary for me to
take any more medicine. It is now several days since I took the last of the
medicine, and have not had any return of the disease. The desire to
masturbate seems to have left me, and I feel well, happy and strong. When I
look back to the time before I commenced to take your medicine, the change
that has taken place seems wonderful. I had lost all hope of being restored
from the ruinous habit I had practiced for many years without knowing how
fatal it was to health. I tried hard to stop the practice, but it had grown
so strong on me that I would always practice it again, and was fast
becoming impotent. Had emissions at night; was nervous, downhearted; and I
lost flesh, and felt miserable in many ways too numerous to mention. But
now I feel healthy and well. If I had been more careful, and had not
stopped treatment so soon before, I might have been cured in four or five
months. Nevertheless, I am well satisfied, and thankful that I am restored
to health in six months; and I wish to express my sincere thanks to you and
your Institution, for I owe my restoration to health and happiness to you.
If in the future I need any medical skill, I shall always apply to your
Institution, being certain of receiving the best attention. Yours
thankfully, S., Pittsburgh, Pa.</p>


<p><b>CASE 62,365. Very Bad Case of Spermatorrhea and Impotency. Cured with
six months' treatment.</b></p>

<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: <i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;It has now
been nine months since I stopped your treatment, and as there has been no
return of former symptoms, I judge there can be no doubt as to my cure
being permanent. I must confess that, having been duped and swindled by so
many previous to visiting you, I had not much confidence when I went to
Buffalo to see you. But your specialists, and your Manager, seemed to talk
so straightforwardly and without making any of those extravagant promises
that I have become so used to, that I became convinced of your skill before
I had been long in your wonderful Institution. I think almost any invalid
who will visit your Hotel, and see for themselves the wonderful appliances
that you have accumulated for the cure of disease, must soon become
convinced that if there can be any hope of relief it can be secured there,
if anywhere. There I saw those who told me they had been brought there on
beds or couches for hundreds of miles, and that they had not been able to
walk for two to four years, and yet with two or three months' treatment
were able to go about everywhere, and were about ready to return home. Such
experiences as these established my confidence, and to-day I bless the day
I first visited the Invalids' Hotel. True, it took six months to cure me,
but I presume you seldom have cases to equal in severity the condition I
was in when I applied to you. I was so bad, as you will remember, though I
do not suppose you rely upon any thing but your records in referring to
cases, having so many under treatment at all times, at all events, if you
will turn to the record of my case, which is "File No. 62,365," you will
see that I had discharges of semen every time my bowels moved and without
erections. In fact, I was completely impotent. I am now as strong and
vigorous as any man. You told me it would probably take a year to cure me,
but as you accomplished it in five months, though I continued to take
medicine a month longer to insure against a relapse, I think myself very
fortunate. Should any of your staff have occasion to come this way, I
should be only to glad to do any thing I can to entertain them.</p>

<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: <i>Dear Sirs</i>&mdash;It was my
pleasant privilege to read concerning your skill in the treatment of all
kinds of diseases, and concerning your reputation, which is most justly
merited. Encouraged by these facts to place explicit confidence in you. I
beg leave to state my own case as clearly as I may be able. It is as sad as
it is fatal if no thorough cure can be effected. I have from my twelfth
year onward been practicing, though not excessively, the evil,
<i>self-abuse.</i> Although I have been led to abandon the pernicious habit
for several years, my age being twenty-four, the horrible effects have not
disappeared. The serious result is that I am suffering from spermatorrhea.
An involuntary discharge of the seminal fluid occurs invariably once, not
infrequently twice, every week during sleep. The genital organs have become
diminished in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_797"
id="Page_797"></a>[pg 797]</span>size. I will proceed to state the symptoms
which I have been able to observe. They are&mdash;disposition to solitude,
inaptitude for study, indolence, forgetfulness, melancholy, weakness in the
back (especially perceptible after standing), a lack of confidence in my
own ability, want of energy, sometimes pain in the chest, elbow, arm,
knees, and loins. Uneasy nights, disturbed and highly disagreeable dreams
becoming more and more irritating as the time for the discharge of the
seminal fluid draws nearer, also a desire to lie longer in bed in the
morning.</p>

<p>Now, dear Doctors, permit me to ask your kind advice as to what means

<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: <i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I have
finished the eight months' treatment; had I been able to follow the
directions more closely, three months' treatment would have effected a
permanent cure of my case. Now I am well, body strengthened, mind
invigorated, memory revived, energy to work restored, cheerfulness and
bright hopes, once altogether lost, are now fully regained. Indeed, I feel
like a new being. And now, dear Doctors, in closing our important

to me, and for the benefit received from your invaluable treatment. Adieu;
may God grant you a long life, that you may benefit many an afflicted
one.</p>

that it has ever been the lot of man to fall into. My whole system is
invigorated; I have no more weak back nor legs; no more emissions; my
strength is greatly increased, and my weight is more than it has ever been

<p><b>CASE 110,838. Seminal Weakness and Fistula in Ano.</b></p>

<p>A case of anal fistula that had been unsuccessfully treated by
Prof. &mdash;&mdash;, of Nashville, who had operated with the knife. He had also been
unsuccessfully treated by several home physicians who stated that his
symptoms of spermatorrhea were all that could be described, and more too.
The sensations of crawling and itching in the rectum were very severe, and
as a result of weakness there was a serious palpitation of the heart, and
general debility. The generative organs were unduly excitable and weak. He
complained of weakness in the rectum and loins, with irregularity of the
bowels, trembling and weakness of the entire system. There was profuse
discharge from the fistula and also from the urethra. We undertook his case
without making any promises of a radical cure, as it seemed that the
disease had progressed so that it would be impossible to effect more than
satisfactory improvement in his general condition, and a palliation of the
symptoms of disease. At the end of seven months' treatment he writes as
follows:</p>


<p><b>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION:</b> <i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;The
result of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_798"

cure of the fistula beyond a doubt, and in a magical manner. My heart is
very much improved, so that it does not trouble me in the least. My health
is perfect in every way. It is unnecessary for me to order any more
medicines, but should I think at any time that a little is required to keep
me in good health, I will order at once. I think that I am entirely through
with the fistula and sympathetic weakness, and I can truly say that your
remedies delivered me from the jaws of death. With sincere thanks to you, I
am, yours for ever. D.</p>


<p><b>CASE 140,056. Spermatorrhea</b>.</p>

<p>The following long-standing and aggravated case of seminal debility
began to yield at once under the specific influence of our medicines.
Frequent nocturnal emissions were present, and the semen also passed off,
unobserved and unsuspected, in the urine; of course a ceaseless vital drain
of this character began quickly and profoundly to impress the constitution,
so that when the patient under consideration applied to us for relief, the
most unmistakable symptoms of commencing organic disease of the heart and
lungs had plainly declared themselves to be present. Like many hundreds, of
similar cases which we cure annually, the disease yielded promptly and
perfectly to the well-directed efforts of our specialist in this important
branch of practice; indeed, so easy, swift and perfect was the cure that
the patient failed to realize the necessity of continuing the treatment a
few weeks in order to insure himself against the possibility of a relapse,
and discontinued his correspondence with us, whereas it is in precisely
such cases that we recommend the treatment to be not too abruptly
discontinued.</p>


<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:
<i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;Your kind favor, thoughtfully inquiring after my health,
came duly to hand. In answer, permit me to say that it was not my intention
to take further treatment as I considered my cure to be perfect, all local
and general symptoms having wholly subsided before I had finished the
month's course, and thus far manifesting no disposition to return. However,
in the light of your wisdom and experience, I have reconsidered the matter
and now believe with you that another month's course of treatment is
advisable, in order effectually to guard against the possibility of a
relapse. I accordingly inclose you the price of the additional month's
course. The second morning after commencing the use of your medicines I
awoke refreshed in body and mind, and this experience has been repeated
every morning since. The emissions were arrested at once, and I have not
had a single unnatural discharge since, except once when I experienced a
slight nocturnal emission, which, however, was followed by no depressing
after-effects, but altogether the reverse. I feel so much stronger and
better in all respects that It is a positive pleasure for me to do a hard
day's work now.</p>

<p><b>CASE 86,291.</b></p>

<p>This gentleman had suffered during eleven years from seminal weakness as
the result of indiscretions in youth; nocturnal emissions were present, and
there was also a seminal loss with the urine, and at stool; the patient's
memory was greatly impaired and his mind otherwise affected from the vital
drain; he was dyspeptic, his bowels were costive, and threatening symptoms
of consumption had already begun to manifest themselves when he came under
our care. Two months of our special treatment, at the patient's home,
effected a perfect and permanent cure, and completely arrested all abnormal
seminal losses. The following grateful letter is from the gentleman in
question:</p>

<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:
<i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;Permit me to say that, six months after having
discontinued your treatment, my cure remains perfect. This great permanent
and enduring benefit was secured to me through only two months of your
skillful treatment and careful management of my case. Your medicines had a
wonderful control over my disease, driving away its terrible symptoms as if
by magic; they imparted to me a new power, filled my body and mind with
unusual vigor, and transformed me from one racked with pain and living
death or worse, to a full measure of health and happiness. I feel that if I
had not been opportunely and successfully treated by you, that my life
would have been permanently blighted, and that the happy and contented mind
that now inspires these lines would ere this have been dethroned of reason.
I feel that you have been my savior. I have not had a single nocturnal
emission since leaving your treatment, six months ago. Thanking you,

<p>Did the interest of our readers demand it, we could add to the preceding
list an almost endless number of extracts from letters written by grateful
patients, expressing their heart-felt thanks for having been <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799"></a>[pg 799]</span>cured
of spermatorrhea and impotency by our treatment. But we have we trust given
sufficient to illustrate our great success in dealing with these
maladies.</p>

<p><b>A Caution to the Afflicted</b>. We are daily consulted by persons
suffering from spermatorrhea and impotency who have been victimized by
ignorant charlatans. Some seek to dupe and swindle the unwary by claiming
to have themselves been cured of spermatorrhea or impotency by some
prescription, which they offer to send free to any sufferer. When the
prescription is obtained it is found to consist of a few articles
well-known to every druggist, coupled with certain arbitrary and fictitious
terms, unknown to everybody and not to be found in any medical work extant.
Following the prescription is a modest suggestion that if it cannot be
filled by the home druggist, the benevolently-disposed party furnishing the
prescription will be pleased to send the medicine, already prepared, for
from three to five dollars. Of course, the whole scheme from beginning to
end being a swindle, when the "medicine" is obtained and taken it proves
entirely useless. Skill and genuine merit do not go begging. Men who spend
hundreds of dollars for the publication of advertisements offering to give
away valuable information can always be safely set down as swindlers.</p>

<p>In the public prints will be found advertised various ready prepared,
"put-up," or proprietary, so-called "remedies," "Specifics," "Boluses,"
"Pastiles," "Rectal Pearls," "Urethral Crayons," "Voltaic Belts," "Galvanic
Belts," "Batteries," and "Pads," all recommended as infallible remedies for
spermatorrhea and impotency.</p>

<p>A vast experience in the treatment of these affections has satisfied us
that each case must be studied and treated according to the symptoms
manifested, and that medicines that are adapted to one stage of the disease
are entirely unsuited to other stages of the same case. No "Pad" or
"Battery and Pad," "Galvanic" or "Voltaic Belts," "Battery," "Bolus," or
"Soluble Crayon," ever did or can help a case of this disease, except it be
in the imagination. Although the proprietors of the most popular
proprietary medicines in the market, medicines carefully adapted to the
cure of the diseases for which they are recommended, yet, should we attempt
to get up a general remedy to cure spermatorrhea and kindred maladies, we
are certain it would be an utter failure, and this is entirely true of all
such preparations now and heretofore offered for sale, and, from the very
nature of the diseases they are recommended to cure, ever must be. Each
case must have medicines carefully prepared to meet the conditions present,
and when these conditions, from the effects of treatment or other causes,
change, the treatment must be varied accordingly.</p>

<p><b>Positive Injury</b> instead of benefit often results from the
employment of some of the nostrums advertised for the cure of
spermatorrhea, impotency and kindred affections. Especially have we found
that the use of "Soluble Urethral Crayons," "Boluses," "Pastiles", <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_800" id="Page_800"></a>[pg 800]</span>and
kindred contrivances, which are so extensively advertised, are exceedingly
injurious, and often render otherwise moderate and simple cases,
complicated and incurable.</p>

<p>Although of pretended French origin, they are evidently the invention of
an ignoramus, who knows nothing of the delicate anatomy of the generative
organs or of the proper treatment of the diseases incident thereto, for
none other would have thought of such a preposterous plan of treatment. No
man should insert such absurdly devised and mischief breeding contrivances
into his urethra (urinary canal), for thereby he is almost sure to do
himself a permanent injury. So far from having been invented by an eminent
French surgeon, as claimed, such treatment is entirely unknown in France,
and ever has been, as the writer well knows from personal observation and
enquiry while sojourning in that country and visiting its most noted
hospitals and medical institutions.</p>

<p>All the various "Troches," "Boluses," "Wafers," "Suppositories,"
"Pearls," "Rectal Pearls," "Rectal Capsules," and other contrivances which
are recommended for the cure of Spermatorrhea and kindred weaknesses, and
which are designed to be employed by inserting them into the lower bowel
(rectum), and there permitting them to dissolve, are only so many
irrational and filthy devices for duping the ignorant and innocent
sufferers from these maladies.</p>

<p><b>An Alluring Swindle</b>. A still more enticing, and hence more
dangerous, device for swindling unfortunate sufferers, is the widely
advertised "Vacuum Treatment" or "appliance" so loudly and plausibly
recommended for "Developing weak and wasted organs." A simple, little,
brass air pump, connected with a glass tube, or cylinder, fitted with a
valve at one end, which costs not to exceed one dollar and a half, is the
worthless device palmed off on the confiding ones <i>at from fifteen to
thirty dollars</i>. This is done under the <i>false pretense</i> that its
daily use to pump blood into the weak or wasted organs, will cause their
development and growth.</p>

<p>Thousands have invested their hard earned cash in this worse than
worthless, injurious, contrivance. In fact the head of the concern putting
out this alluring device is said to have amassed a fortune out of the
nefarious business.</p>

<p>So far from benefiting any one, out of several hundreds of cases that
have come under our personal observation, in which this apparatus has been
faithfully used for a long period of time, we have never met with a single
case that had derived the slightest benefit therefrom. On the contrary, we
have been called upon to examine many who had been <i>seriously injured</i>
by its use.</p>

<p>The sudden congestion or filling and over-distention of the delicate
blood-vessels of the organ operated upon, caused by placing it in a vacuum,
is liable to rupture these minute vessels, causing the infiltration of
blood into the tissues and giving rise to inflammation, and in some cases,
to <i>suppuration, mortification, sloughing</i> and <i>death</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801"></a>[pg
801]</span>In other cases, the blood-vessels of the organ and adjacent
parts are so weakened by the <i>strain</i> put upon them as to induce
varicocele and other diseased conditions. In spermatorrhea, it is the worst
possible thing that can be applied, for by forcing an undue amount of blood
into the part the sensitiveness of the organ is increased, irritation is
set up in the deep urethra, and the emissions are increased in frequency.
In this, and other ways, hundreds of men but slightly out of health have
been permanently injured.</p>

<p>But this is only a small part of the story connected with the
reprehensible business of palming off "The Vacuum Developing and
Strengthening Appliance." The precious rascals, not content with making
from a thousand to fifteen hundred per cent. profit on the miserable device
furnished, while advertising fifteen dollars ($15.00) as the price of the
"appliance" and "accompanying preparations," for "<i>ordinary cases</i>,"
make a general practice, when they have secured the fifteen dollars
($15.00), of sending it by express <i>with a bill to be collected on
delivery</i> FOR FIFTEEN DOLLARS ($15.00) MORE. With this bill they send an
explanation, that "on re-examining the case" they "found it necessary, or
thought it advisable, to send their stronger and more expensive
preparations and appliances <i>for the worst cases</i> AND SO HAVE CHARGED
FIFTEEN DOLLARS ($15.00) MORE TO COVER THE EXTRA EXPENSE."</p>

<p>It is astonishing that there are those who can be induced to part with
their money for such claptrap devices, and still more so that having been
duped and swindled out of their hard earned money through false pretenses
and promises of benefit held out to them, they should submit quietly to
such extortion and not have the swindlers arrested and prosecuted for
obtaining money under false pretenses as they richly deserve. For what
crime can be more deserving of punishment than the holding out of false
hopes and pretenses to the unfortunate? Employing the United States mails
for swindling is a pretty dangerous business, and sooner or later these
rascals will, we predict, find it out to their sorrow. They are pretty sure
to get hold of some men, ere long, who will invoke the aid of the United
States District Attorney to bring them to justice.</p>

<p><b>Young Man</b>, if you have, through ignorance, fallen into practices
that have arrested your physical growth and development in any of your
organs or parts, shun all such unscientific and worse than worthless
contrivances as you would shun a pestilence. No matter how plausible the
web of arguments woven to entrap you, be assured, they are the utterance of
knaves who care not what false hopes they encourage so they secure your
money.</p>

<p>Consult only those whose well known skill, experience and integrity will
insure honest dealings and the most scientific treatment known to the
"healing art," and who supply the latter at reasonable cost.</p>

<p>Be assured also, that when, through proper treatment, your weakness and
functional derangements are overcome, the parts that have suffered <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802"></a>[pg
802]</span>therefrom, will regain all the strength and development possible
to impart to them through the aid of the physician's skill. Nature often
accomplishes wonders in this direction, when aided by the skillful
practitioner.</p>

<h2>VARICOCELE;</h2>

<h3><i>OR, ENLARGED VEINS OF THE SCROTUM SOMETIMES CALLED FALSE
RUPTURE</i></h3>


<p>Probably no affection of the generative organs has been given more
attention by surgeons than this. Its great frequency, being present in
about one-third of all cases of spermatorrhea, and its disposition to
result in impotency and wasting away of the testicles, bring it constantly
before the profession.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise577"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 1. A healthy testicle." src="images/advise577.png" /></a><br />Fig. 1.
A healthy testicle.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise578"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 2. Testicle wasted from Varicocele. The enlarged and torturous veins
are shown to be about as large as the testicle." src="images/advise578.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 2. Testicle wasted from Varicocele. The enlarged and
torturous veins are shown to be about as large as the testicle.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>.&mdash;Varicocele commonly results from long continued
fatiguing exercise, in the upright position, heavy lifting, jumping,
straining, severe constipation, injuries from horseback riding, bicycle
riding, especially the latter, or any obstruction or obstacle to the free
return of blood through the spermatic veins. Self abuse and excessive
sexual indulgence are also prolific causes of varicocele.</p>

<p>When the spermatic veins are over-distended to such an extent that their
tonicity is impaired, they gradually lose their capacity for transmitting
the blood, and a slowly increasing enlargement and tortuously of veins
results. This goes on, becoming steadily more marked, until the pressure of
the engorged vessels upon the spermatic cord impedes the full circulation
of blood in the testicle and causes a wasting and softening of this gland.
A loss of sexual power and increasing weakness of the generative organs
generally follow this gradual destruction of the testicle, and sometimes
total and incurable impotency results.</p>

<p>This affection is also designated by the terms <i>circocele</i> and
<i>spermatocele</i>. It consists of an enlargement or varicose condition of
the veins of the scrotum or spermatic cord, and affects the left side more
frequently than the right. This is due to the fact that the spermatic veins
of that side are longer, more dependent and tortuous, and, consequently,
support a greater column of blood than the other side. The enlarged veins
feel like a bundle of earth-worms. The knotty and <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_804" id="Page_804"></a>[pg 804]</span>tortuous vessels sometimes
form quite a large tumor, which is, now ever, but rarely sensitive to the
touch, yet sometimes causes a feeling of weight in the scrotum and loins,
and sometimes produces a sensation of numbness in the thighs.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise579"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 3. Well developed Varicocele." src="images/advise579.png" /></a><br
/>Fig. 3. Well developed Varicocele.</p>

<p>When varicocele of an aggravated or largely developed type is present,
associated with any weakness of the generative organs, as spermatorrhea or
impotency, it must be cured before the organs can regain a healthy
condition, as by the constant pressure of the abnormal quantity of blood
and enlarged veins upon the spermatic cord, arteries, and testicles, the
irritability, weakness, and wasting, are increased. The use of suspensory
bandages, with strongly astringent lotions, will, in mild cases, produce
relief and many times cure. Except in the worst cases, it is well to try
these means before resort is had to operative surgical treatment, unless
the patient is anxious to be cured in a more speedy manner. The treatment
by suspensory bandage and lotions is necessarily somewhat slow in producing
remedial results; yet, many quite well marked cases have, in our
experience, been cured by such means perseveringly applied. Although many
who have been unable to come to us for an operation, have been cured by
suspensory bandages and our improved lotions applied to the affected parts,
in all cases in which the veins are very much enlarged, we recommend the
sufferers to come here and undergo our surgical treatment, which is
painless in its execution and radical in its results.</p>

<p>It has been recognized by physicians and surgeons for over a century,
that in bad cases of varicocele a cure can only be certainly and
permanently effected by operation. Many have been the methods of operation
advanced by the prominent surgeons of every age, but all have met with such
an alarming mortality, that they have been one by one abandoned, except as
a last resort in extremely bad cases. A late author gives the percentage of
deaths from the various old operations, now in general use throughout this
country and Europe, as varying from seven to fifteen per cent. of all
cases. In contrast to this, we point with pride to our records, by which we
are shown to have operated upon over a thousand cases by our original
method, obtaining in each and every instance a perfect cure, without a
single alarming symptom or a death ensuing. This we think is sufficient
evidence of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_805" id="Page_805"></a>[pg
805]</span>the perfect safety of the operation and its superiority over
every other method. So every sufferer with the disease, we would recommend
it as a positive means of securing a permanent cure. Various worse than
useless devices are advertised by quacks, who, as a class, are afraid to
undertake surgical treatment for the cure of varicocele. One has what he
calls a "varix clamp," or "clasp," to be worn upon the enlarged veins. Many
"compressors" and other equally useless devices are advertised and sold for
the same purpose. These are not only perfectly worthless, but positively
dangerous in their application. The pressure they make upon the spermatic
cord, nerves, and artery, is very apt to result in impotency and a rapid
wasting away of the testicles. Patients should avoid all the catch-penny
devices recommended for varicocele, as none of them are worth a moment's
consideration.</p>

<p>Even a moderate degree of morbid enlargement of the spermatic veins will
sometimes cause such engorgement and obstruction to the free circulation of
the blood in the testicle, as to cause gradual wasting or shriveling of
that organ. In some cases the morbid condition will give rise to seminal
weakness, or spermatorrhea. Many of these cases that can only be cured by
surgery, are trifled with by quacks, who attribute the spermatorrhea, or
loss of semen, to everything else than its true cause&mdash;varicocele.</p>

<p>To illustrate, Mr. B., of Colorado, applied at the Invalids' Hotel and
Surgical Institute, a few years ago, and said he had for five years been
troubled with nightly emissions of semen and his testicles were gradually
wasting away. He had been under the treatment of men making great
pretensions as specialists, to whom he had paid several hundred dollars in
the vain hope of getting cured of spermatorrhea. They treated him with
medicines only, and did him no good whatever. On examination, we found a
very varicose or enlarged condition of the left spermatic veins, and gave
it as our opinion that the seminal loss was wholly due to this abnormal
condition and could only be cured by an operation that would remove the
varicocele. The operation was promptly performed. In two days he was able
to leave his bed, and in a week started home to Colorado. Some months
thereafter we received a letter from him wherein he said: "The enlarged
veins continued to absorb and grow less and less, until, in a few weeks'
time, all unnatural enlargement had disappeared. With a steady improvement
in the condition of the veins, I experienced corresponding improvement in
my general health, and the seminal losses grew less and less, and finally,
long ago, disappeared entirely. I feel that my manhood, with all the powers
that should belong thereto, are mine to enjoy. In other words, my
restoration to health is complete. Had I saved the large amount of money
that I fooled away on those quacks, and given it all to you, I feel that
you would then have been only fairly paid for the great good you have done
me."</p>

<p>The foregoing is but a fair sample of letters that we are almost
constantly <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806"></a>[pg
806]</span>receiving from those who have pursued useless treatment for
spermatorrhea, dependent upon varicocele, and have been speedily cured by
our never-failing operation for this malady. Among the great variety of
operations in surgery for various diseased conditions, performed by our
surgeons, none have been attended with more uniform satisfaction, and
perfect success, than has our operation for varicocele.</p>


<h3>A PAINLESS OPERATION.</h3>

<p>By the injection of a few drops of a medicated solution under the skin,
at the point where the incision is to be made, we are now able to produce
such complete local an&aelig;sthesia as to render the operation <i>entirely
painless</i> without the administration of either chloroform or ether. This
is an important consideration, as many are averse to taking chloroform or
ether, and now that we are possessed of an agent that produces, locally,
<i>complete insensibility to pain</i>, we are very glad to be able to
dispense with their use in all such minor operations. Many examinations
heretofore very painful, as of the bladder for stone, and of the deep
urethra for strictures, are now rendered <i>entirely painless</i> by the
use of this wonderful agent.</p>

<p>A great variety of surgical operations are now performed by our surgeon
specialists, without any suffering on the part of our patients, by the
local use of an an&aelig;sthetic solution injected into the parts to be
operated upon. Formerly we were obliged either to administer chloroform or
ether, or subject our patients to a great deal of suffering. Our
specialists were among the first surgeons in this country to employ local
an&aelig;sthesia successfully. We regard it as a great boon to our
patients, and never withhold it in any case where it can be employed to
prevent suffering, its use being attended with no danger and followed by no
bad or disagreeable results.</p>


<h3>OUR PAINLESS OPERATION.</h3>

<p>Having operated with unvarying success, during the past twenty-five
years, upon several thousand cases of varicocele, at the Invalids' Hotel
and Surgical Institute, we now invite special attention to the results of
our peculiar operation, which is neither severe nor dangerous, and from
which the patient makes a much more rapid, and in every respect more
satisfactory, recovery than from other operations in use by surgeons
generally. In our practice we have never failed to secure the happiest
results from our operation. The saving of time is also of importance to the
laboring man as well as to the millionaire. Instead of being confined to
his bed for ten to twenty days, and to his room for a month or more, as is
the case following other operations, the patient is not confined to bed at
all, and can generally return home in a week or ten days at the longest.
The only precaution necessary is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807"
id="Page_807"></a>[pg 807]</span>that he should, for a reasonable time
after the operation, wear a well-fitting suspensory bandage. This can, in a
little time, be entirely dispensed with. When we contrast these results
with those obtained from ligation, graduated pressure by "clamps," suture
pins, or the slicing off of a part of the scrotum, and suturing, or
stitching, the wide gaping wound so caused, as is practiced to-day by other
surgeons, the marked superiority of the results obtained, through our
superior method of operating on this affection, must be apparent.</p>

<p>A very large part of those cured by our treatment have previously spent
far more money for worthless "electric suspensories," "equable scrotal
compressors," "scrotal clamps," various "rings," and other "jim cracks,"
than was paid us <i>for a radical and permanent cure</i>. Some of these
instruments are so formidable as to suggest the racks and thumbscrews of
the middle ages. Such useless appliances often weaken the scrotal muscles
by the unnatural compression which they produce and make the discomfort far
worse when they are discontinued than before their use.</p>

<p>For such cases as cannot come to us at once for an immediate and
<i>perfect cure</i>, we have a common sense method of treatment,
comparatively inexpensive, that gives relief and comfort in all cases, and
in mild cases often effects a complete cure. This treatment leaves the
scrotum and its contents in an improved, strengthened and more healthful
state.</p>

<p>TESTIMONIALS.</p>


<p>If the following letters had been written by your nearest, most
respected and trustworthy neighbors, they could not be entitled to more
confidence than they now are, coming, as they do, from intelligent
citizens, each one of whom, in his own neighborhood, enjoys the full
confidence of all his acquaintances. These letters are taken at random from
among hundreds of similar ones, received from former patients of ours,
residing in all parts of the United States and Canada, and if it would add
anything to the endorsement in the way of giving greater confidence in our
ability to treat successfully the malady under consideration, we could
multiply the letters which we here introduce many times over. To publish
more, however, would seem to be tedious repetition, for there necessarily
must be a sameness in all such letters testifying to our skill, and we
must, therefore, be content to rest our case with the limited number of
endorsements which we have room for only in this volume.</p>

<p><b>A Perfectly Painless Operation. Patient Smokes a Cigar and Talks with

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I suffered with varicocele at the age of nine years,
caused by a fall, and doctored for same about fifteen years, and obtained
no relief. Renowned surgeons of Pittsburgh, New York, and other cities
pronounced my case incurable.</p>

<p>I heard of the Invalids' Hotel, No. 663 Main Street, Buffalo, N.Y., and
entered it as a last resource. On the third day after entering the
Institution I was treated, and during the operation (which was a painless
one), I smoked a cigar and talked with the operating surgeons, feeling
<i>no pain whatever</i>. I remained in the Hotel one week, and during that
time I never once was unable to walk to the elevator and have my meals in
the dining room. The tables were laden with the best the country can
produce. It is truly "The Invalids' Hotel" (or rather <i>home</i>), as the
clerks and nurses are very kind, attentive and social.</p>

<p>Will add, that I am permanently cured, and advise any person thus
afflicted not to hesitate entering the Invalids' Hotel for treatment.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I feel it my duty to thank you for the benefit I
received at your Institution during the month of December, 1892.</p>

<p>I was afflicted with varicocele on the left side, which caused me a
great deal of trouble and almost made me feel at times that I did not want
to live any longer if I could not be restored to soundness again. Hearing
of your skill in the treatment of varicocele I determined to give you a
trial, which I accordingly did, and with gratifying results for now I am as
sound and well as a gold dollar.</p>

<p>The operation which was performed on me at your Institution for the
permanent cure of varicocele was, to my great surprise, entirely painless
and performed in a much briefer time than I expected. I only remained at
your noble Institution ten days after the operation, at the end of which
time I returned to my home at Chatham Hill, Smyth Co., Va. When I got home
I experienced very little soreness from the operation and I felt that I
could enjoy life fully. About six months after, I got married and came to
Utah where I now reside, and I am very much pleased to say that I am now as
sound and well as ever, and very happy in my married state.</p>

<p>When I went to your Institution I was surprised to see such a great
number of young men from almost every State in the Union, who had come
there to be operated upon for varicocele; and they all told me that the
operation was painless to them, as it also was to me, and they said they
were fast improving and were glad they had come there for treatment. I
never experienced such great and unprecedented kindness as I did during the
ten days I was at the "Invalids' Hotel." I had an excellent room&mdash;well
furnished, plenty to eat, and was treated with the kindness of a mother by
the nurses and attending physician.</p>

<p>I advise all who are afflicted with varicocele to go to your Institution
at once for an operation, which I assure them they will never regret.
Trusting that those who require an operation of any kind, or who are
afflicted in any way, may go to your Institution and be restored to health,
and again thanking you for my restoration to health and <b>your</b> great
kindness and good treatment of me while I was with you, I remain,</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;It is with great pleasure I recommend those suffering
from varicocele to your skillful hands. I suffered with varicocele for
seven years, caused by standing behind the counter at business from seven
in the morning until ten and twelve o'clock at night.</p>

<p>In 1888 a friend gave me a copy of your Common Sense Medical Adviser.
After perusing its pages I was convinced of the genuineness of its
doctrine. I immediately started for Buffalo&mdash;a distance of 1,900 miles.
During my stay of ten days at your Institution I was treated with the
utmost kindness by the nurses and surgeons, all of whom are expert
specialists.</p>

<p>The equipment of the Institution is something immense. I often think of
the appetite those healthy exercises in the treatment room gave me when
dinner time came.</p>

<p>After being in the Institution three days I underwent an operation for
varicocele&mdash;an injection of medicine locally making the operation
<i>absolutely free from pain</i>. The operation was performed in about
thirty minutes, immediately after which I could walk to my room, and, after
resting an hour, descended to the dining room and took my dinner as
usual.</p>

<p>While at the Institution I met numerous persons suffering from
varicocele, and it was quite pleasing to contrast their happy looks as they
wished you "goodbye" with the haggard appearance they had upon
entering.</p>

<p>After leaving the Institution I traveled about 1,400 miles by rail and
500 miles by water without the least inconvenience, which I consider a fair
test of the operation.</p>

<p>Five years have passed since that time, and I now feel as sound as it is
possible to feel.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me say to those suffering from varicocele that it is
impossible for them to do better than follow my example.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I am a carpenter and some years ago, I fell from a
scaffold which in time almost killed me. I wasn't hurt very much at the
time, but a dull aching pain seemed to take me in the left side of the
scrotum, and after I could stand it no longer, I went to my doctor. He said
that I had a rupture of the blood veins of the left testicle, and it was
incurable. I gave up in despair; but at last, a friend handed me some of
your advertising papers, and I saw the Common Sense Medical Adviser
advertised and sent for the book and studied its contents carefully, and
came to the conclusion that I was suffering from varicocele. I found on
consulting you that my suspicions were right. I at once wrote you for
particulars, and in less than a week I was at the Invalids' Hotel for
treatment. At that time no one knows how I suffered; but I hadn't long to
suffer. In ten days after <i>an entirely painless operation</i> I was a
well man and returned home.</p>

<p>I cannot say too much in regard to the treatment and care from both
Surgeons and Nurses. Nothing was left undone to promote comfort and good
care. It is the only place on earth that I would feel safe to trust my life
for a severe operation. There were, I think, over 100 patients at the
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, at the time I was there, and as I
had a good chance to be with them, I found that they were all doing
remarkably well.</p>

<p>At the date of my operation which was the 7th of March, 1893, I weighed
just 165 pounds; to-day I weigh 189. I have gained in health, strength and
vigor every day, I believe.</p>

<p>I would just say, in conclusion, that I can give my word as an honest
man to any sufferer that I believe he can be cured of almost any chronic
malady at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I am unable to find words to express my feelings of
gratefulness and gratitude that I owe to your Institution, for the able and
gentlemanly treatment that I was favored with during my stay with you, by
officials and attendants in their respective capacities, in every
department. Nothing was left undone that could possibly be of benefit to me
or add to my comfort, and to your Institution, your treatment, which in my
own experience I have found to be marvelously wonderful, I feel to-day as
if I owe my health, my strength, my life; for I firmly believe if it had
not been for your timely and painless treatment, instead of writing to you
at this time, being in the enjoyment of health and strength, I would be
filling a place in an insane asylum or an invalid's grave. And it may not
be more than just to your wonderful treatment to say that the Varicocele
and resultant weaknesses was of about fifteen years' standing, during which
time I had spent time and money with both physicians and quacks, without
any result for the better, and when my life blood was daily wasting away,
and the powers of manly strength and vigor were completely gone, by an act
of Providence I went to your Institution as a last resort, for life or
death. I was painlessly operated upon by you for my complaint, from which
time I have steadily improved in health, strength, weight and vigor, until
I have gone from 135 pounds, my weight when operated upon, to 174, at which
I tip the balance as I write to you to-day. If the afflicted everywhere
could only realize that so many lives may be spared by your wonderful
treatment, none would stay away.</p>

<p>You are at liberty to give my testimony to the world in whatever way it
may be of most benefit to you. I also enclose a photograph of myself that
has been taken since the effects of your treatment have been shown. With
feelings of much gratefulness, I am,</p>

<h4>RUPTURE OF SPERMATIC VEINS.</h4>

Needle in Flesh; Successfully Extracted at Invalids' Hotel.</b></p>

<p>"WHAT I THINK OF THE INVALIDS' HOTEL AND SURGICAL INSTITUTE:"</p>

<p>The Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute is an Institution first-class
in every respect, presided over by a capable, honest and pleasant lot of
medical experts who certainly know their business. I cannot speak of it too
highly.</p>

<p>I was treated there in the summer of 1887, for Rupture of the Spermatic
Veins, previous to which I had been operated on two different times, with
no relief, by a doctor here in this place cracked up to be one of the best
in Northern Illinois, and an officer of the Chicago Eye and Ear Infirmary.
The operation at the Invalids' Hotel was perfectly painless, did not have
to take any an&aelig;sthetic, neither was I confined to my bed at all, and
the result a perfect success; while in the two previous operations I had
here at home, I was confined to my bed a week each time and another week
scarcely able to move about, be sides getting worse each time with pain
enough to drive one crazy. But the half has not been told. About two and a
half years after I had been cured of my difficulty at Buffalo, I commenced
having terrible pains in my leg and abdomen, for which I could not account,
and after standing it until it seemed as though I would be glad to die, I
again consulted the Invalids' Hotel; after a thorough investigation they
operated on me where my pain seemed the most apparent, and dug out a piece
of a surgeon's needle something over half an inch in length, that had been
broken off in the first operation I had by the doctor here at home, and so
admitted by him when confronted with it. I have spent lots of money and
nearly six years of the worst pain man ever stood getting relief, while had
I known of this place on <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815"
id="Page_815"></a>[pg 815]</span>the start, an operation with no pain
whatever and scarcely more discomfort than a sore mouth after having a
tooth removed, would have ended it all.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I will say to any poor sufferer, don't do as I did and
put your trust in the would-be greatest doctor you have at home, but go to
this place at Buffalo, where you will have proof of their ability, and
where you will surely meet patients about to leave, cured; others on their
way to recovery for the same difficulty you may have yourself, no matter
what it is, if curable at all; a place where you will have the kindest of
attention, the best of medical and surgical skill, and where you can see
sufferers going away every day with hearts full of gratitude and happy.</p>

<h4>VARICOCELE-FALSE RUPTURE CAUSED BY INJURY.</h4>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;In the year 1866, sometime in July, I jumped from a
load of lumber to the ground, and at once felt a sharp severe pain along
the spermatic cord of left side of scrotum, preventing my walking to the
house without help. The veins near the cord filled to such extent that they
seemed solid, and could not be reduced for some time. I went to a good
doctor and by him was advised to "pay no attention to it, it will not
amount to much." From that time I suffered continually, and will not try to
describe what I endured until I was relieved by a surgical operation
performed on me by the surgeon-specialist of the Invalids' Hotel and
Surgical Institute, of Buffalo, N.Y. After working-hard for several years
my suffering increased and I was advised to consult Prof. L., of Chicago
Hahnemann College (of Homeopathic School) and by him was informed an
operation of tieing the veins (choking them off) could be performed but 90
per cent (if I remember rightly) of the operations proved fatal. I decided
not to try it. By accident I learned of your great skill, and though my
case was of twenty-one years' time, and my health and strength gone, I
considered the method plausible and reasonably safe. I had the operation
performed, and now after six years have passed, I can say with
satisfaction, there is little to be noticed or remind me of the past years
of misery. The parts are of healthy-color. Urine has assumed a natural
appearance, both sides of scrotum seem in size alike. No bandage is worn
and for two years has been discarded. My weight increased and for two years
prior to the taking of my photo, I did the work of handling a third-class
post office, doing a money order business of $50,000, not losing a day in
that time, and at the present time in this hot climate, I have been doing
outdoor work, some of it hard, and with mercury at 100 degrees. I have
worked and found no need of a bandage; and no unnatural relaxation of the
scrotum or veins is noticed.</p>

<p>If anyone wishes to write me, they are at liberty to do so. If my
experience can be of benefit to any, I will answer all enquiries, and in a
general way will now say no one should delay attending to such difficulty,
for if the blood is in a reasonably healthy condition your surgeon will
operate in such a way that the result will be all right in time. I send
photo taken in 1891.</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>&mdash;Having been afflicted with varicocele and loss of
manhood and having heard so much of the cure for these troubles at the
Invalids' Hotel. Buffalo. N.Y., I went there and was operated upon. The
operation itself is nothing to bear. It is painless and the result is a
radical cure. For this you have my sincere thanks. I take pleasure in
recommending your Institution to all sufferers and know that it is in every
respect just as claimed to be. I would say to all who suffer from this
trouble: go to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, at Buffalo,
N.Y., and you will get relief. You will receive kind attention from
all.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I can bear testimony to the removal of varicocele, for
which you treated me. I had been in the habit of getting out with the boys
and trying to see which could kick the highest with one foot on the ground,
and it caused me to have varicocele. I went to my home doctor and he
treated me with no success. It was getting worse all the time and I got out
of shape all over. My health got bad and I thought my case hopeless. I had
tried two doctors and received no benefit.</p>

<p>I had one of your little Memorandum Books in my pocket, and one day,
looking through it I saw you treated such cases, and wrote you and received
word in a few days that you would treat me, so I sent off for one month's
treatment; and in five months I had gained my weight back, and that was
eight years ago and I feel sound and well and my health has been good ever
since.</p>

<p>You are at liberty to use my testimony in whatever way if may be of most

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I commenced treatment, I think, in July or August, of
1888, and continued four months. My case was nervous debility of fifteen
years' standing.</p>

<p>I tried home doctors but found they were only aggravating my case. I
also tried the Remedy Company, then of St. Louis, who claimed to perform
wonderful cures with their "Pastiles," but they proved utterly worthless.
Having come in possession of Dr. Pierce's little book and circulars, a
perusal of the same convinced me that my health would not be trifled with
at his Institution.</p>

<p>I was a poor man and could not afford much experimenting. I ordered one
month's treatment, and at the end of this first month, I found, to my
surprise, that I was feeling different. The second month, still more
surprised at my returning health. Third month thought I was cured, and
engaged myself to a young lady, and wrote you to that effect, and you
advised me with your congratulations to marry, and to order another month's
treatment; and at the end of the fourth month I was a <i>man</i>, something
I did not know what it would be like to be before.</p>

<p>I have now been married five years, and have two healthy children&mdash;a boy
and a girl. I would never have dared to marry had it not been for your
medicines. I must add that during this treatment I was troubled with
varicocele on left side. I wrote you this at third month of treatment, and
you sent without extra charge, a Suspensory and Lotion, and two months'
treatment cured me sound and well of this distressing malady; I have not
felt the least symptoms of its return.</p>

<p>I want the world to know what a competent and honorable firm the World's
Dispensary Medical Association is. I would love to shake you by the hand.
May God let you continue to be a help to mankind is my prayer.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I feel many obligations to your noble skill, as
physicians. I was treated with much kindness by physicians and nurses. I
was surprised to find such a speedy cure of such a bad case of varicocele
of long standing; the operation was entirely painless and I felt a great
change in myself, as a result of it. Am so glad to tell any sufferer of
that terrible disease to apply to you at once and be cured, for I am sure I
could not have lived long as the pressure and burden was so great <i>I
could scarcely be on my feet at all</i>; any work in an upright position
was impossible.</p>

<p>Now it has been five years since I was operated upon and I feel well of
that disease&mdash;varicocele attended with impotency or weakness of the
generative organs, caused by varicocele.</p>

<p>Thanks to the good physician who relieved me&mdash;hope he may live long and
be able to relieve all that submit themselves to him for treatment, as I
did. I found everything that had been described to be just so in regard to

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;With great gratitude toward your most valuable
Institute, I feel indebted to you for the cure of varicocele. I was
troubled ten years with this annoying disease, caused, I think, by being
thrown from a horse. My case was of a very obstinate character. I was
treated by a leading specialist of Omaha, Nebr., without success and
without being in the least benefited. I expended the neat little sum of
$500, and then sank back in despair, losing all hopes of a cure. I had
previous to my treatment in Omaha noticed a little hand or Memorandum Book
of the World's Dispensary, and again one came to my notice. I mustered up
courage to write to you, and in June, 1892, I visited your Institute for
treatment. I was treated by the best skilled surgeons and given best
attention by experienced nurses. I met a number of patients while under
treatment troubled with various and complex diseases, who expressed their
gratitude to the Faculty of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute. The
operation performed was rendered painless, owing to local applications
previously applied. After the operation, which was about 11 o'clock, A.M.,
I rested until 12, noon, and responded to the dinner call as usual. I was
required to remain but ten days, then returned home, a distance of some
twelve hundred miles. I wore a neat fitting support for about six months,
and then abandoned it and have gone as nature created me. Oh, what a
relief. I had worn a "suspensory" for about six years. I have had no return
of former trouble, it being now about two years since the operation.</p>

<p>To any suffering with varicocele I must say, "don't delay, but place
yourself under treatment at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute,
Buffalo, N.Y., and you will say as I do, 'The half has never been told.'"
With earnest wishes for your future success, I am,</p>

<p>This is to certify that I took treatment at the Invalids' Hotel and
Surgical Institute, Buffalo, N.Y., and I was cured of a chronic trouble
that had been maltreated by other physicians. While there I saw a man who
had been cured by the specialists, who had before been given up to die by
the best doctors in Troy, N.Y. Of course, the case must have been a very
stubborn one. I afterwards saw a man here, in Georgia, die, who, if he had
been in Pierce's Surgical Institute under the treatment and care of his
skilled doctors and nurses, I know would have most assuredly got well. Why?
Because it was only a case of <i>stone in the bladder</i>, and they are
easily cured at Dr. Pierce's Surgical Institute. I think almost any chronic
disease can be cured there, if taken in time, judging from my observations
while an inmate of that Institution.</p>

<h1>HYDROCELE,</h1>

<h3>OR DROPSY OF THE SCROTUM.</h3>


<p>This malady consists of a collection of water in the <i>tunica
vaginalis</i>, or membranous sac which contains the testicles. It may
affect either one or both sides. In health the sac-like covering, or
investing membrane, of the testicle secretes a limpid fluid which
lubricates its inner surface. When secreted in excess, it accumulates and
constitutes <i>hydrocele</i>.</p>

<p>The tumor commences at the bottom of the scrotum and grows very
gradually, while hernia, or rupture, with which it is often confounded,
progresses from above downwards and makes its appearance suddenly.</p>

<p>We were recently consulted by an aged gentlemen, whose disease a
distinguished surgeon had pronounced <i>double hernia</i>. On examining the
enlargement, we found the disease to be dropsy of the scrotum, complicated
with varicocele.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Injuries from blows or bruises are among the most common
causes of this disease. It may also result from inflammation of the
testicle or from excited action in those parts. It has been known to result
from stricture of the urethra, or water-passage, and also from local
irritation along that passage.</p>

<h1>THE URINARY ORGANS:</h1>

<h2>THEIR ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY.</h2>


<p>By reference to Fig. 1 the reader will get a good understanding of the
relative positions of the kidneys, bladder, and adjacent organs.</p>


<h3>THE KIDNEYS.</h3>

<p>It is hardly necessary to discuss the minute structure of these organs
in a book intended for the non-professional reader.</p>

<p>The function of the kidneys is to remove certain waste materials from
the blood. As fast as excreted by the kidneys, the urine passes through the
ureters, of which there are two,&mdash;one leading from each kidney, into the
bladder. The ureters are lined with a continuation of the mucous membrane,
reflected from the bladder upwards, and this lining also extends to the
cavities of the kidneys.</p>

<p>Calculi or gravel, and stones, forming, as they sometimes do, in the
kidneys, and passing down through these delicate and sensitive canals,
cause excruciating pain. The symptoms of renal calculi passing from a
kidney to the bladder are, as already indicated, severe cutting pain in the
loins, and along the ureter, attended with considerable fever. A very rough
stone, such, for instance, as a mulberry calculus, passes with considerable
difficulty, and the patient is often suddenly seized with excruciating
agony in the loins and in the groin, the pain also shooting down into the
testicle of the corresponding side, often causing it to retract. There is
usually, also, sympathetic pain shooting down the thigh. We have seen
patients roll on the floor in the greatest agony, cold sweat meanwhile
pouring down their faces, when thus suffering. The patient may also vomit
violently, through nervous sympathy. The urine is apt to be bloody, and
there is a constant desire to pass it. There is pain in the end of the
penis, and also in the lower portion of the abdomen.</p>


<h3>THE BLADDER.</h3>

<p>This is a sac, or reservoir, to receive and hold the urine as it comes
from the kidneys through the ureters. Its walls are partly composed of
muscle, and partly of a lining mucous membrane. The muscular coating is
external, and it is by its contraction that the urine is expelled. When
empty, the bladder shrinks down to a small size, as compared with its
distended condition. When filled, it is capable of holding about one pint.
If it is distended by the retention of urine much beyond <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824"></a>[pg 824]</span>this
capacity, the muscular coats lose their force, and often the urine cannot
be passed naturally. In health, when the bladder becomes filled and
distended, there is a consequent desire to empty it by passing water.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise615"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 1." src="images/advise615.png" /></a><br />Fig. 1.</p>

<p>The voiding of the urine should not be attended with the slightest pain
or disagreeable sensations, and the desire to pass it should not be
frequent. When there is frequent desire to pass it, or when its passage is
attended with pain, there is irritation, or inflammation, in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_825" id="Page_825"></a>[pg 825]</span>the
coats of the bladder, or in the urethra. This may arise from an excessively
acid or irritating condition of the urine, as well as from various other
causes. Gonorrhea, or clap; stricture of the urethra, which impedes the
free flow of the urine; enlargement or inflammation of the prostate gland;
gravel, and stone in the bladder, are all capable of creating a frequent
desire to pass water. Whatever the unhealthy condition may be which gives
rise to this troublesome symptom, it calls for prompt and skillful
treatment, for the most trivial affections of these organs often pass into
those that are exceedingly intractable, if not incurable.</p>

<p><b>The Examination of the Urine</b>. The urine itself, when subjected to
microscopical or chemical examination, as we shall hereafter more fully
explain, offers the best means of determining the exact nature of these
distressing affections. When normal, the urine is of a pale straw-color,
and throws down no deposits on cooling. In passing it no difficulty or pain
should be experienced, and it should spurt from the urethra in a full,
round, and regular stream, until the bladder is entirely emptied. If the
stream is forked, checked, or interrupted in any way before the bladder is
completely emptied, it is evidence that something is wrong. Stricture of
the urethra, prostatic disease, and gravel, or stone in the bladder, are
all capable of producing obstruction to the free flow of the urine.</p>

<p><b>How Slight Ailments become Dangerous Diseases</b>. As we have before
stated, the mucous membrane lining the bladder is reflected upwards into
the ureters, lining these canals. By reason of this continuity of mucous
surfaces, patients suffering from urethral, prostatic, and bladder
affections, often die from disease of the kidneys. It must not be supposed
that because stricture of the urethra does not co-exist with <i>Brights</i>
disease, that the latter may not have been caused by the obstruction in the
urethra due to stricture. Pulmonary consumption, for instance, often begins
in the form of nasal catarrh, but, by the continuity of the mucous
membrane, it travels, so to speak, into the throat, or pharnyx; from the
pharnyx into the larnyx, and then into the lung structure itself. The
disease is transferred from the nose into the lung tissue. What occurs in
the nasal, laryngeal, and pulmonary tract of mucous membrane, happens,
also, in the urinary tract. A gonorrhea, which is a specific acute
inflammation of the urethral canal, leaves behind it a slight gleet, or
chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane of the urethra. This may give
little inconvenience for a number of years, but gradually it culminates in
a stricture, or, implicating the prostatic portion of the urethra,
occasions inflammation of the prostate gland, and, perhaps, enlargement of
this organ. This gradually gives rise to cystitis, or inflammation of the
bladder. From the bladder, the disease travels up the ureters into the
kidneys, and finally <i>Brights</i> disease is established in these
organs.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane lining the bladder also extends through the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_826" id="Page_826"></a>[pg
826]</span>urethra. Throughout the interior of the body, whether it be in
the stomach, lungs, or other parts, this lining mucous membrane serves as a
protection to the parts beneath, just as the skin on the exterior of the
body serves as a protection to the sensitive true skin and the tissues
underneath it.</p>

<p><b>The Cause of Certain Distressing Symptoms</b>. Close to the neck of
the bladder is a triangular space, on which the mucous membrane is
smoother, and devoid of folds, or rug&aelig;, and which is far more sensitive
and vascular than other portions of the mucous membrane lining this organ.
It is called the <i>trigone vesical</i>. This <i>trigone</i> is the most
depending part of the bladder. If there be stone in the bladder, it
naturally gravitates and rests on this sensitive space, so that, when the
bladder is empty, the foreign body occasions inconvenience, until the
urine, trickling down through the ureters, and intervening between the
mucous membrane and the stone, serves as a temporary protection to the
mucous surface. Hence the pain becomes less as the urine is secreted, until
the water is again passed, and the intervening fluid thereby removed, when
the stone again presses upon, and irritates, the sensitive <i>trigone</i>,
by coming into more immediate contact with it. The greater ease with
patients afflicted with stone experience in a recumbent position in bed, or
on a sofa, compared with being in an erect posture, is easily explained.
The foreign body, when the patient is standing, walking, or riding, falls
by its own gravity on this sensitive spot; when in a recumbent position, it
rolls away from this sensitive <i>trigone</i> into the back part of the
bladder, where the mucous membrane is less sensitive; consequently, the
patient suffering from stone in the bladder is more easy at night, whereas,
one suffering from prostatic disease, whether it be inflammation of the
prostate gland, or enlargement of that organ, is usually worse in bed.</p>

<p><b>How Bladder Diseases come to be Confounded with other Diseases.</b>
The bladder is largely supplied with blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves,
given off from the same systems that supply the rectum or lower bowel, and
in females the uterus or womb, and the ovaries. This accounts, in a great
measure, for the symptoms of bladder disease in those afflicted with piles,
or other diseases of the lower bowel, or of diseases of the uterus or womb
in the female. We have frequently been consulted by patients who had
erroneously supposed themselves to be suffering from disease of the
bladder, or of the prostate gland, but whom we found, on examination, to be
suffering from hemorrhoids, or piles. In these cases, by removal of the
pile tumors, the frequent desire to urinate, and all pain in the region of
the bladder, are promptly relieved. Sometimes, ulcers located in the
rectum, give very little unpleasant sensation in the bowel, but produce
pain in the bladder, with frequent desire to urinate. Enlargement of the
uterus, the womb, or displacements of that organ, as prolapsus, or
anteversion, and all capable of producing symptoms of bladder disease. A
frequent <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_827" id="Page_827"></a>[pg
827]</span>desire to urinate and more or less sharp pain in the region of
the bladder are usually experienced in these cases. Disease of the bladder,
in like manner, often produces an apparent disease of other organs through
sympathy, and without great care in diagnosticating each case, the
<i>effect</i> may be taken for the <i>cause</i>, and the patient treated
for a disease which does not really exist.</p>


<h3>THE URETHRA.</h3>

<p>The urethra, in the male, is the canal extending from the bladder to the
end of the penis, through which the urine is passed. This canal starts from
the base of the bladder, passes through the prostate gland, and, entering
the penis, continues of about uniform size along the under part of the
penis until it reaches the glans, or head of that organ, where it expands
somewhat into a bulb-like fossa, or cavity, and becomes reduced again at
the orifice. At a short distance from the bladder it receives the outlets
of the seminal ducts. The urethra is a most delicate and sensitive canal,
and is surrounded by tissues of like delicacy, and is lined with a mucous
membrane which is highly vascular, and filled with sensitive nerves. The
introduction of any instrument into this canal is to be undertaken only
when absolutely required, and when necessary. It should be so skillfully
and carefully effected that no pain or irritation can result. The slightest
awkwardness is liable to cause an unnoticeable injury, which may result in
a false passage, or an effusion of plastic lymph around the canal, which,
organizing, forms the most troublesome kind of organic structure. By proper
and early treatment all danger and pain is avoided, and a cure effected in
a very short time. In an extensive practice, in which we yearly treat
thousands of cases, we have never yet failed to give perfect and permanent
relief from stricture, or disease of the prostrate gland, without the
necessity of using cutting instruments of any kind, when we have been
consulted before injury to the urethra has been produced by the improper
use of instruments. Having specialists who devote their entire time and
attention to the study of these diseases, we are able to relieve and cure a
large number painlessly and speedily, in which the awkward manipulations of
physicians or surgeons, whose hands, untrained by constant and skillful
use, not only fail to effect any benefit, but set up new, or aggravate
existing, disease.</p>

<p>This subject will receive a more full and complete consideration in
another part of this treatise.</p>


<h3>THE PROSTATE GLAND</h3>

<p>The prostate is a gland of about the size and shape of a large chestnut,
lying just in front of the bladder, and surrounding the urethra. The size
of the prostate gland varies considerably with the age of the person. In
early life it weighs but a few grains. As puberty approaches it becomes
larger, and in the adult weighs from half an ounce to an ounce. In old age
it enlarges considerably, and sometimes presses upon <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_828" id="Page_828"></a>[pg 828]</span>the
bladder so as to impede the flow of urine. This condition is often
confounded with stricture, gravel, or stone in the bladder, by
inexperienced physicians. Hypertrophy, or enlargement of the prostate
gland, is not an unfrequent disease in the adult or middle-aged man. Being
in close contact with the bladder, when it enlarges it encroaches on the
bladder, pressing on it, and it has the effect of interfering with the
function of urination. As before indicated, enlargement or hypertrophy of
the prostate gland, is often confounded with stricture, gravel, and stone
in the bladder, by inexperienced physicians, and treated accordingly. The
true condition of this gland is readily determined by an examination
through the rectum or lower bowel, the finger of the expert surgeon being
able to determine at once whether it is enlarged or not.</p>

<p><b>The Danger of Bad Treatment</b>. In disease of the prostate gland, as
well as in inflammation of the kidneys and bladder, stricture of the
urethra, and many other forms of urinary disease, the use of stimulating
diuretics, and the much-advertised "kidney cures," "buchus," and similar
preparations, which largely increase the flow of urine, simply aggravate,
and do positive harm. In fact, the most difficult cases that we have had to
deal with have been those that, through such treatment, either taken on
their own account or prescribed by inexperienced physicians, have been
rendered so much worse as to make their cases very intractable, and tedious
to relieve and cure.</p>

<p><b>Require Nicely Adapted Treatment</b>. As we have heretofore
indicated, there is no class of diseases that require nicer adaptation of
medicines to each individual case, than those of the urinary organs.
Medicines which, in one stage of these diseases are beneficial and
curative, in another stage are often exceedingly injurious. Hence it is
that we claim it to be impossible for any one to put up any set
prescription, or proprietary medicine, that will meet the wants of a large
percentage of this class of cases. The only rational course to be pursued
is to examine carefully each case as it is presented; find out the exact
condition and stage of the disease with which the patient is afflicted, and
then prescribe for it such special medicines as are nicely and exactly
adapted to the patient's condition. These, in many cases, will have to be
changed from time to time, to suit the ever-changing condition of the
disease, as it is modified by the treatment. Not only have the
manufacturers of "buchus," "kidney cures," etc., committed grave errors by
prescribing stimulating diuretics for almost all kidney and bladder
diseases, under the impression that, as the patient passes only a small
quantity of urine at a time, the kidneys should be stimulated to secrete
more, but physicians in general practice have been very prone to commit the
same error in their practices. When the bladder and kidneys are in a weak
and diseased condition, incapable of efficient action, the bladder being
already unable to dispose of the diminished quantity of urine secreted, it
is simply outrageous practice to administer medicines calculated to <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829"></a>[pg
829]</span>stimulate the kidneys to perform more work. By being thus
forced, these organs become seriously diseased. It would appear most
unreasonable to whip and spur a horse already jaded from overwork. Common
sense would dictate rest, which always does good; but, as the bladder is
weak, the doctor whips up the kidneys with drugs, thus endeavoring to force
them to secrete more urine, and thereby the poor, crippled bladder, which
is incapable of disposing of even the diminished quantity secreted, is
actually made to do more work in a diseased and feeble condition, than it
would perform in a sound, strong, and healthy state. The results of this
pernicious practice are <i>Bright's</i> disease of the kidneys, cystitis or
inflammation of the bladder, and numerous other grave maladies.</p>

<hr />




<h2>KIDNEY DISEASE.</h2>


<p>Diseases of the kidneys are generally very slow in their inception,
coming on gradually and manifesting no special symptoms of their presence
until they have assumed a formidable character. For this reason they are
the more dangerous. Simple derangement of the urinary secretion is no
evidence of disease of these organs, as changes in the color, quantity and
specific gravity of the urine are often produced by changes of temperature,
active or sedentary habits, mental emotion, and sometimes by articles of
diet, or drink, as well as by the use of different drugs.</p>

<p>The existence of disease of the kidneys in the early stages can only be
positively determined by a microscopical and chemical examination of the
urine, which reveals to us the presence of casts, epithelia, blood, pus,
etc. The microscope informs us not only of the presence of disease, but
very often of the particular portion of the kidney in which it is located,
as well as of the stage which the disease has reached. We are also aided by
chemistry in determining the exact abnormal condition of the kidneys by the
detection of albumen, sugar, etc. These examinations, by aid of the
microscope and chemical re-agents, should never be neglected by the
physician. Without them his diagnosis, or judgment of the patient's
condition, is simply guess-work. With them he is enabled to base his
treatment upon certain and positive knowledge of the patient's real and
true condition.</p>

<p>The usual symptoms of chronic disease of the kidneys, but which vary
materially with the age, constitutional peculiarities and temperament, are
weakness in the small of the back, pains in the region of the loins and
groins, numbness of the thigh on the side of the affected kidney (for often
only one organ is affected), high-colored and often scalding urine, many
times depositing a sediment, sometimes white or milky urine, bloody urine,
frequent desire to pass the urine, partial impotency, pains in the
testicles and shooting into the loins, suppression or inability to pass the
urine, gravel, stone in the bladder, dropsical swellings, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830"></a>[pg
830]</span>swelling of the testicles, irritability and pain in the bladder,
mucous and sometimes seminal discharges oozing from the urethra.</p>

<p><b>When the Bladder is affected</b> the prominent symptoms usually
complained of are irritability of the bladder, accompanied by a frequent
desire to urinate, inability to retain more than a small quantity of urine,
and this for a short time only, pain in the region of the bladder,
extending into the back, thighs, etc., hot scalding sensations in passing
the urine, sediment in the urine, and sometimes bloody urine. The appetite
is usually diminished, there is a depression of spirits, the urine is often
passed only by drops, and is irregular in quantity and quality, frequent
inability to pass the urine at all, in males partial impotency, with dull
disagreeable pain in the testicles and irritation of the urethra, attended
with mucous and sometimes seminal discharges oozing from the urethra. Some
of these symptoms may be present as the result of functional or organic
disease of other organs than the kidneys or bladder, and to distinguish
them with positive certainty is impossible without the aid of a
microscopical and chemical examination of the urine.</p>

<hr />




<h2>BRIGHT'S DISEASE.</h2>


<p>This affection may appear in either an acute or chronic form. The acute
form is frequently a complication, or sequel of scarlet fever, diphtheria,
cholera, typhoid fever, erysipelas or measles, and is frequently developed
by intemperance. The acute form of the disease is very rapid in its
progress, often destroying life by ur&aelig;mic poisoning&mdash;the retention of urea
in the system.</p>

<p>The symptoms of the acute form are diminution or suppression of urine,
dry skin, chills, thirst, pains in the loins, and a general dropsical,
puffy condition of the system, especially manifesting itself in the earlier
stages under the eyes, but gradually showing itself in the oedema, or
swelling of the feet, and lower extremities generally. Unless promptly
relieved, the patient dies of coma (stupor), or from convulsions. No person
should be so rash as to attempt the treatment of this dangerous affection
without the aid of the best medical skill that can be procured.</p>

<p><b>It is the Chronic Form of Bright's Disease</b> that we propose
principally to discuss in this article. True Bright's disease of the
kidneys is an insidious and most fatal form of organic disease.</p>

<p>We venture to assert that less than one per cent. of those who imagine
they have "Bright's," have this disease at all. We find that most of those
who, as one of our Faculty puts it, <i>insist upon having</i> Bright's
disease, base their "diagnosis" upon the ever-changing condition of the
urinary secretion, and especially upon the copiousness of the deposit;
whereas, in true Bright's, deposits of any kind are rarely met with.
Perhaps the form of deposit most commonly mistaken for Bright's disease, is
that known to medical men as the <i>urates</i>. When the urates <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831"></a>[pg 831]</span>are in
excess they form a heavy pinkish deposit of a flocculent nature within from
five to thirty minutes after the urine has been passed&mdash;that is, after it
has been passed sufficiently long to cool. To prove that the deposit is
urates, heat the specimen to the temperature of the blood, when the deposit
in question will disappear. Excess of urates has now been definitely
traced, in the majority of instances, to functional torpidity of the
liver.</p>

<p>Another common form of deposit is that in which the reaction of the
urine, instead of being acid, as in health, is either neutral or alkaline,
and in which the earthy phosphates are precipitated for this reason. The
earthy phosphates, when thrown down by a neutral or an alkaline condition
of the urine, appear as a heavy white deposit, which, though usually devoid
of clinical significance, is certainly calculated to frighten timid
patients who read of the "terrible ravages of Bright's" in the
advertisements of various popular "kidney cures." To prove that the
precipitate is phosphatic in its nature, add a few drops of vinegar and it
will disappear; whilst, if, after the vinegar has been added, the specimen
be brought to the boiling point, not only both the urates and phosphates
remain in solution, but there is only one single substance known to
pathological chemistry that can form a deposit under these conditions&mdash;and
that substance is albumen, which, if present in quantity, is always
indicative of serious disease.</p>

<p>The papers are filled with the plausible but unwarranted statements of
the manufacturers of various "kidney cures," who anxiously desire that
every one should be impressed with the idea that all their troubles arise
from kidney disease in order to sell large quantities of their medicines.
In many cases the unfortunate patient is rendered much worse by the use of
remedies that are not suited to his condition, and which will not cure the
real trouble with which he is affected.</p>

<p>Daily we are consulted by persons in whose cases these errors have been
made. In reality, true Bright's disease is not a common affection, and nine
out often individuals who think that they suffer from it, or the early
stages of the trouble, in fact have something more curable. In some cases
it is an affection of the liver, which forces an excretion of unnatural
salts by the kidneys, and thus renders the urine acrid and irritating, or
they may be suffering from some other disease, such as a deformity or
enlargement of certain glands, as the prostate; unnatural position of the
organs, as with women who suffer from weakness, the uterus pressing forward
on the bladder and urethra, and thus showing every evidence of disease in
the urinary canal. It is as common for persons to suffer from deformity of
the urinary canal as from misshapen limbs, or from noses and ears not of
proper size and proportion.</p>

<p>The urinary canal, from the bladder outward, is narrow and delicate. Any
disease or injury therein is liable to result in gradual contraction, which
may be manifested long years after the cause has been forgotten, or has
disappeared. These affections, to the inexperienced, or the physician <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832"></a>[pg 832]</span>who is
not particularly alert and cautious in his diagnosis, are liable to cause
error, and he will pronounce a given case Bright's disease, when in reality
there is some simple cause for the irritation of the urinary canal, and the
pains in the kidneys, etc., all of which frequently result from a slight
damming up of the flow of water, and the prevention of free expulsion from
the system of the salts of which the body is relieved by the kidneys. They
cannot work under pressure. When, from any cause, the flow of water is
checked, and, as it were, dammed up so that a slight pressure is put upon
the kidneys below, their secretion is most materially interfered with, and
the many trains of symptoms that usher in disease of the kidneys,
appear.</p>

<p>The true, and only sure way to relieve these conditions, as can be
understood by any one, is to remove the real cause. The use of any medicine
that stimulates the kidneys to an irritable action, under such pressure, is
to be avoided, as it only makes the trouble worse, increases the amount of
water that is dammed up, and results in more serious manifestations of
constitutional disease; whereas, by merely relieving the choked outlet, the
flow of water becomes free, and the kidneys are speedily restored to their
natural condition. This is well illustrated by the following:</p>


<p>Case 113,396.</p>

<blockquote><p></p>
As recorded at the Invalids' Hotel. L.C.K., farmer, age 41, married. For a
period of nearly ten years, as a result of slight injury, he had suffered
from cloudy
and unhealthy-looking water, with some burning on passing it; frequent
calls to
urinate; swelling of the limbs, loss of energy and strength; headache,
etc.; gradually
there appeared severe pain in the back, at times recurring with a sense of
fullness
in the abdomen. For a period of nearly eight years he had been constantly
treated by physicians at his home, all of whom had investigated his case.
He had
made several long journeys to consult the manufacturers of a
much-advertised
"kidney cure," who, after pretending to examine his urine, scientifically
(none of
the proprietors are physicians), assured him that, without the shadow of a
doubt,
his disease was Bright's, and that he might be cured by their "kidney
cure," which
was for sale at all drug stores. For a period of eighteen months he
steadily took
this "cure," which, he states, he is sure aggravated his disease, as,
although his
sufferings at times were less, he felt that he was not improving in the
least, and
that his disorder was not being properly controlled. His home physician
went
with him on several occasions, consulted with the owner of the proprietary
medicine,
and was equally mistaken in his diagnosis. After consulting many doctors,
all of whom assured him they could give him treatment that would prolong
his
life somewhat, and make his condition comfortable, but that no treatment
would
affect his cure, he was induced, by reading our article, heretofore
referred to, to
consult us. A very thorough examination of the case was made, which
resulted
in finding two contractions of the urethra, which admitted only the
smallest sized
probe, and which, necessarily, prevented the free flow of the urine. These
were
speedily removed, when, much to the surprise of his family physician, who
accompanied
him, over thirty-seven ounces of fluid were drawn from the bladder. This
gave him immediate and perfect relief. The pains and aches in the region of
the
kidneys, the weakness and tenderness, and the many other uncomfortable
symptoms
with which he was troubled, all disappeared. From a feeble and irritable
invalid,
in a few weeks he was converted into a happy and cheerful man. The symptoms
of congestion and irritability of the kidneys gradually disappeared, and in
thirty days after visiting us he writes that he feels himself entirely
sound and well.
This gentleman states that he will be pleased to correspond with any one
who
wishes to learn the particulars of his case, and his full name and address
will be
furnished to any inquirer.
</blockquote>

<p>Bright's disease when fully established is characterized by degeneration
of the kidneys. Submitted to examination, after death by this disease,
these organs present various appearances. Hence, the degeneration <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_833" id="Page_833"></a>[pg 833]</span>that
characterizes the disease has been designated as waxy degeneration. Some
pathologists contend that the disease consists of several different renal
maladies, all of which, however, agree in the one ever-present symptom of a
more or less albuminous condition of the urine.</p>

<p>As to the causes of kidney disease, it may be said that any thing which
will give rise to a greater or less degree of congestion of the kidney will
induce either a temporary albuminous condition of the urine, or a true
Bright's disease of the kidneys. Suppression of perspiration, by exposure
to cold and wet, want of cleanliness, deficiency of nutritious diet, liver
disease, certain poisons in the system, as of scarlet fever, measles,
erysipelas or diphtheria, taken in conjunction with sedentary habits, bad
air, excessive mental labor or worry, may each occasion an albuminous
urine, and finally result in Bright's disease, but of all causes that
appear to produce this disease, none are so prolific as intemperance. A
scrofulous diathesis, or habit of body, may strongly predispose to the
disease, and chronic kidney disease frequently follows acute rheumatism and
the practice of masturbation. In some instances the chronic form of
Bright's disease follows an acute attack, but is more often developed
slowly and insidiously without any known cause.</p>

<p><b>The Symptoms</b> of this fatal malady generally appear so gradually
that they excite but little or no concern until it has reached its more
advanced and dangerous stages. Frequently, a puffy, watery or flabby
condition of the face, particularly under the eyes, is the first symptom
noticed, and the patient may observe that his urine is diminished in
quantity. The urine is sometimes abundant, but generally more scanty than
in health, is acid in its reaction, and generally of a low specific
gravity. The countenance is generally somewhat pale and bloodless, which,
taken with the dropsical condition of the system, and the constant
albuminous condition of the urine, points the expert specialist to Bright's
disease of the kidneys. Various circumstances and conditions may give rise
to the temporary presence of albumen in the urine, and, although albumen
may be temporarily absent from the urine even when Bright's disease exists,
yet this is not common. There are certain indirect symptoms which point
clearly and almost unmistakably to the presence of this disease. These are
deep-seated pain or weakness in the back, gradual loss of flesh, red,
brown, or dingy urine, more or less drowsiness, and as the disease
advances, a smothering sensation, or difficulty in breathing, with
dropsical puffiness or swelling. Occasional attacks of nausea and vomiting
are common; pains in the limbs and loins, which are often mistaken for
rheumatism. Irregularity of the bowels is also common. The skin becomes
harsh and dry, not perspiring even under active exercise. Sometimes these
symptoms are years in their development, being very obscure at first, and
in some cases the disease has been known to prove fatal without the patient
having experienced any extraordinary symptoms. With those whose systems are
enfeebled by want, intemperance, exposures or disease, as scrofula or <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_834" id="Page_834"></a>[pg
834]</span>syphilis, the first symptoms usually observed will be a frequent
desire to urinate, occasional attacks of diarrhea, flatulency, dropsical
swelling of the face, especially under the eyes, and afterwards of the
extremities, paleness and increasing debility. Stupor, apoplexy and
convulsions are the forerunners of a fatal termination.</p>

<p>Microscopical and chemical examinations of the urine are the only
reliable means of diagnosis, and should be often repeated. (See Urinary
Signs, in Appendix.) As albumen is often present in the urine without the
existence of Bright's disease, it is impossible, except by the aid of the
microscope, to distinguish true Bright's from other affections of the
kidneys. In both purulent urine, and that containing blood, albumen will be
found by the usual tests, but in smaller quantity than in Bright's disease.
Albumen, with disintegrated epithelia, hyaline, and large granular casts,
as well as waxy casts, are peculiar to, and characteristic of, this
disease.</p>

<p>In the treatment of this malady, our specialist's experience has been
very great, and attended with marvelous success. Of course, after the
substance of the kidney has degenerated and broken down, and become
destroyed to any great extent, a cure is impossible. But that we now
possess remedies of great value, and specific power over this terrible
disease, we have the most positive evidence in the remarkable success
attended in its treatment. Most cases that are curable can be managed
successfully at a distance, the necessary medicines being sent either by
mail or express. Our specialists have cured many in this way who were so
bloated from dropsical effusion as to weigh twenty-five to forty pounds
more than usual. In our Sanitarium, where we have had the advantage of our
Turkish baths and other appliances, we have cured some cases in which the
removal of the dropsical effusion reduced the patient's weight sixty
pounds.</p>

<p>We cannot, In conclusion, too strongly condemn the general resort to
strong diuretics so often prescribed by physicians for all forms of renal
maladies, but which, by over-stimulating the already weak and delicate
kidneys, only aggravate and render incurable thousands of cases annually.
Not less harmful are the many advertised "kidney cures," "kidney remedies,"
"buchus," and kindred preparations. They all contain powerful, stimulating
diuretics, and, while they may appear for a short time to do good,
invariably render the case worse and far more difficult to cure. The cases
of Bright's disease reported cured by these preparations are cases of far
less dangerous maladies, made to appear, by exaggerated accounts of them,
as true Bright's disease. The use of these general, ready-made or
proprietary remedies in any case of true Bright's disease is hazardous in
the extreme. In no disease is there greater necessity for treatment nicely
adapted to the exact condition of the patient (which should always be
carefully ascertained by microscopical and chemical examinations of the
urine) than in this. As it is a disease that runs a slow course, there is
always time to send samples of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835"
id="Page_835"></a>[pg 835]</span>the urine for examination by expert
specialists, and no other physician than a specialist of large experience
should be entrusted with the treatment of a malady so dangerous in its
character, and in the diagnosis and treatment of which general
practitioners commit such frequent, and often fatal, errors. <b>(See
Testimonials</b>.)</p>


<h3>DIABETES. (POLYURIA AND GLYCOSURIA.)</h3>


<p>There are two essentially different varieties of this disease, one of
which is called <i>Diabetes Insipidus</i>, or <i>Polyuria</i>, and the
other <i>Diabetes Mellitus</i>, or <i>Glycosuria</i>. The first is
characterized by an increase in the amount of urine excreted, and yields
readily to proper treatment. The second is characterized by the presence of
sugar in the urine, and under ordinary treatment often proves fatal.</p>

<p>The <i>causes</i> are obscure, and are therefore not very well
understood by the profession.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. A notable increase of the quantity of urine excreted is
the first symptom which attracts the patient's attention. Frequently,
several quarts, or even gallons, of urine are daily excreted, and it is
paler than natural. The patient experiences extraordinary thirst, and has
an almost insatiable appetite, though at the same time he loses flesh and
strength. The tongue may be either clammy and furred or unnaturally clean
and red. The bowels become constipated, and a peculiar odor is observed in
the patient's breath and exhales from his body. The skin becomes harsh,
dry, and scurfy. There are dizziness, headache, dejection, lassitude, and
not unfrequently blindness, caused by cataract, is developed in one or both
eyes. The intellect is blunted, and, as the disease progresses, the
emaciation and debility increase, and pulmonary diseases develop; or,
perhaps, an uncontrollable diarrhea sets in, and the patient dies from
exhaustion.</p>

<p>In this disease, as in Bright's, we have many medicines that produce
specific curative effects, enabling our specialists to treat it with
greatly increased success. The disease is readily diagnosticated, or
determined, by chemical examination of the urine, so that we have been
enabled to treat this class of cases very successfully at a distance, and
without personal examinations. Great attention should be paid to the diet
in these cases. It should be highly nutritious, but anything of a sweet or
starchy nature must be avoided.</p>

<p>The following articles are wholesome and afford sufficient variety,
viz.: of animal food&mdash;beefsteak, game, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, cream,
butter; of vegetables&mdash;spinach, dandelion greens, turnip tops,
watercresses, lettuce, celery, and radishes; of drinks&mdash;tea, coffee,
claret, water, brandy and water, beef-tea, mutton-broth, or water
acidulated with tartaric, nitric, citric, muriatic, or phosphoric acid. The
<i>forbidden</i> articles are oysters, crabs, lobsters, sugar, wheat, rye,
corn or oatmeal cakes, rice, potatoes, carrots, bests, peas, beans, pastry,
puddings, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_836" id="Page_836"></a>[pg
836]</span>sweetened custards, apples, pears, peaches, strawberries,
currants, etc., also beer, sweet wines, port, rum, gin, and cider. (<b>See
Testimonials</b>.)</p>


<h3>CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER.</h3> <h3>(CHRONIC CYSTITIS.)</h3>


<p>This affection, also called <i>catarrh of the bladder</i>, is an
inflammation of the mucous lining of this organ. It may occur at any period
of life, but it oftenest appears in the aged, and is usually associated
with some obstruction to the flow of urine.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. It may be due to colds, injuries, irritating diuretics,
injections, extension of disease from the kidneys or adjacent organs,
intemperance, severe horseback riding, recession of cutaneous affections,
gout, rheumatism, etc.; but it more frequently results from stricture of
the urethra, enlarged prostate gland, gravel, and gonorrhea. It is also
caused by an habitual retention of the urine, and sometimes results from
masturbation or self-abuse.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. There is an uneasy sensation in the bladder, and
heaviness and sometimes pain and weakness in the back and loins. The urine
is scanty, and, although there is a desire to void it frequently, it is
passed with difficulty. If allowed to stand, it deposits more or less
mucus, which is sometimes mistaken for semen. As the disease progresses,
the quantity of the mucus increases. It is very viscid, and adheres to the
sides of the vessels, so that if an attempt be made to pour it out, it
forms long, tenacious, ropy threads. Sometimes the quantity of mucus is so
great that on exposure to cold the whole mass becomes semi-solid, and
resembles the white of an egg. The excreted urine is alkaline, acrid,
exhales a strong odor of ammonia, and soon becomes exceedingly fetid.
Sometimes the urine becomes so thick that great difficulty is experienced
in expelling it from the bladder. Nocturnal emissions, impotency, and loss
of sexual desire are apt to ensue. Occasionally there will be a spasmodic
contraction of the bladder, with straining and a sensation of scalding in
the urethra, and sometimes the patient is unable to urinate.</p>

<p>When ulceration occurs in the progress of the disease, as it is apt to
in its advanced stages, blood will occasionally be seen in the urine. In
the advanced stages of the disease the system becomes greatly debilitated,
emaciation supervenes, with hectic fever, nervous irritability and,
finally, death.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. A strict observance of the rules of hygiene is
essential to a cure. We must ascertain the cause if possible, remove it,
and thus prevent it from perpetuating the disease. The various causes and
conditions involved in different cases demand corresponding modifications
of treatment; hence, it is useless for us to attempt to teach the
non-professional how to treat this complex disease. We have succeeded in
curing many severe cases without seeing the patient, being guided in
prescribing by indications furnished by microscopical and chemical
examinations <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_837" id="Page_837"></a>[pg
837]</span>of the urine. (See Urinary Signs in Appendix.) In fact, nearly
all cases can be cured at their homes, and without a personal examination
being made. In the worst cases, we have found it best to have our patients
at our institution, where we can wash out the bladder with soothing,
healing lotions, and thus make direct applications to the diseased parts.
(<b>See Testimonials</b>.)</p>


<h3>GRAVEL.</h3>


<p>When the solid constituents of the urine are increased to such an extent
that they cannot be held in solution, or when abnormal substances are
secreted, they are precipitated in small crystals, which, if minute, are
called <i>gravel</i>. Another cause of the precipitation of these salts is
a stricture of the urinary canal which, by interfering with the free
expulsion of all the fluid from the bladder, results in the retention of a
portion, which gradually undergoes decomposition. Salts from the urine are
thus precipitated in the same way that they are thrown down in urine which
is allowed to stand in a vessel. Any one can illustrate this, by allowing a
small quantity of the urinary secretion to stand for a few days either in
an open or a closed bottle. Soon a white, flaky deposit will be observed,
which will become more and more dense, and finally fine grains will be seen
precipitated at the bottom of the bottle. Similar grains, lodging in the
folds of the bladder, gradually increase in size, by the precipitation of
more salts around them, and ultimately become a source of much irritation.
When of large size, they are termed <i>calculi</i> or stones. When these
formations occur in the kidneys they are termed <i>renal calculi</i>; when
in the bladder, <i>vesical calculi</i>. There are several varieties of
gravel, each depending upon different conditions of the system for its
formation. The two prominent varieties are the red, containing uric acid,
and the white, or phosphatic, gravel.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. When the deposits are in the kidneys, there is pain in
the back and loins, occasionally cutting and severe; sometimes it darts
down the course of the ureter to the bladder, and extends even to the
thighs. When the deposits are in the bladder, there is a frequent desire to
urinate, with a bearing-down, straining pain; also a cutting or scratching
sensation in the urethra during micturition. In the male, intense pain is
often experienced at the end of the penis. When the urine is voided in a
vessel and allowed to settle, a gravelly deposit is seen, generally of a
red or a white color, and the particles varying in size.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. These urinary deposits indicate a general derangement
of the system, as well as a local disease. Nutrition is imperfect and some
of the excretory organs are not properly performing their functions, or,
perhaps, some portion of the body is being too rapidly wasted. Very
frequently we find these gravelly formations as the result of a rheumatic
or a gouty diathesis. It is also a well-known fact that torpidity of the
liver throws an excessive amount of work on the kidneys. These organs then,
in part, perform the function of the liver, and hence <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_838" id="Page_838"></a>[pg
838]</span>unnatural activity is required of them, and the secreting of
such substances as uric acid, which precipitates readily and gives rise to
severe irritation of the urinary canal.</p>

<p>In order to treat these cases rationally and successfully, it is first
necessary to ascertain by microscopical and perhaps chemical examinations,
the character of the deposit. By such an examination, the exact condition
of the system which gives rise to these abnormal products may be definitely
determined, and the remedies to be employed indicated. As the
non-professional are not qualified to make such examinations, it would be
useless for us to suggest specific treatment for the various forms of this
affection.</p>

<p>Samples of the urine may be sent to us with a brief description of the
symptoms experienced, and the proper medicines to cure can be returned by
mail or express. Our specialists are treating, with uniform success, large
numbers of cases in this way. (<b>See Testimonials</b>.)</p>


<h3>STONE IN THE BLADDER.</h3>


<p>Few affections to which the human flesh is heir are more painful than
this terrible affliction. The cutting operation heretofore required to
remove it, is considered one of the most dangerous operations that the
surgeon is ever called upon to perform.</p>

<p>The death of the Emperor Louis Napoleon, of France, from an operation
for the removal of a stone, at the hands of surgeons renowned for their
skill, gave new impetus to the efforts of surgeons to invent some method
that would be less dangerous than that which has been heretofore commonly
employed. The cutting operations have been the rule. Of these the operation
by median-section is the safest, and is most commonly employed for the
removal of stones that are not too large, while the lateral operation is
used where the stone is more than about one inch in its smallest
diameter.</p>

<p>As will be seen by the consultation of any hospital record, the deaths
in these various operations have been, in adults, from one in three to one
in every four cases&mdash;a very large percentage, and sufficient to deter any
sufferer from undergoing an operation except for the relief of a condition
which is in itself worse than death. Even when this alarming death-rate is
explained to sufferers, they willingly undergo the operation, feeling that
they would rather die than longer continue in their pain and anguish.</p>

<p>Our specialists, not satisfied with the results of these operative
measures, in their studies of the disease endeavored to perfect some other
means by which these foreign bodies could be removed from the bladder
without such great danger and pain. The operation by crushing, and removal
without cutting, appeared to them to present the most practicable
advantages, and they therefore devote their entire time to the improvement
of this method for the removal of stone.</p>

<p>The method of crushing was first invented by a French surgeon many <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_839" id="Page_839"></a>[pg 839]</span>years
ago; but, owing to his crude instruments, and the difficulty that was
experienced in expelling the pieces of stone, the operation was seldom
employed by surgeons. The improvements in these methods at the hands of
Bigelow and Sir Henry Thompson, with those that have been made by our
specialists, have resulted in our being able to present to sufferers with
this disease, a means of cure which is, we are assured, the most successful
known to modern medical science.</p>

<p>There have been so far in the history of the treatment of this malady by
the new method of cure, one hundred and twenty-odd cases operated upon at
the hands of prominent surgeons, all of which were with less perfect
methods than that of our specialists, and there were but four deaths in
this large number. By the advantages which are the result of further
improvements by our specialists, we can assure you that this mortality is
even less in our hands; in fact, approaches, as near as possible, to a
perfect method of cure.</p>

<p>We think that in a moderately healthy subject, one in which the kidneys
are not badly diseased as the result of irritation from the calculus, the
operation is almost absolutely safe. The method consists in the crushing of
the stone, and its removal from the bladder by means of small silver
catheters attached to an apparatus which gently and perfectly removes, by
suction, all the pieces which are thrown to the bottom of the bladder. This
operation has now been performed in our institution in a very large number
of cases with uniform success, and the cures have been effected in from six
to eight weeks without a single unpleasant symptom arising during their
progress. By this method it is not necessary to remove the entire calculus
at one operation, if it is a large one. By the old cutting operation this
was required, as the bleeding was great, and what was to be done had to be
done immediately, or the patient would die from the <i>hemorrhage</i>. With
the new method a part of the large calculus, or when several exist, one or
two of them, may be removed at a time, after which the patient can rest and
gain strength for the second; or, if necessary, for the third
operation.</p>

<p>The largest stone removed by us in this way was one weighing between
seven and eight hundred grains, for which three operations were required.
It is necessarily performed under a mild an&aelig;sthetic, which prevents
suffering and secures the perfect relaxation of the patient. In the case in
which this large amount of stone was removed we feel certain that a cure
could not possibly have resulted from a cutting operation, as the heart was
seriously affected, and the physical condition of the patient so low, as
the result of years of suffering, that death would have occurred while
undergoing the operation. By carefully pursuing the new method, and not
prolonging the sittings more than a few minutes each time, the entire stone
was evacuated. The health of the patient constantly improved during the
interval of three operations, which covered a space of seven weeks. This
stone was as large as a hen's egg.</p>

<p>Small calculi or gravel are readily removed in a few moments' time <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_840" id="Page_840"></a>[pg 840]</span>by the
new method. In no case is there any bleeding. Instead of a large, gaping
wound being left after the operation, from which secondary hemorrhage may
take place, or poisoning result from the irritation of decomposing urine,
the parts are left in a healthy state with the surface unbroken. The stone,
a constant source of irritation, is removed, and the health is speedily
restored.</p>

<p>When it is impossible for the patient to visit us, a careful examination
of the urine is made, and if gravel have been passed, these are carefully
examined also. An idea of the composition of the stone is arrived at by
this means, and treatment is directed to dissolve it. Success has commonly
followed this method of treatment, when the stone has not been very large.
With the gradual reduction of the size of the stone the irritation
subsides, and the general health of the patient improves. (<b>See
Testimonials.</b>)</p>


<h3>CHRONIC ENLARGEMENT OF THE PROSTATE GLAND.</h3> <h3>(HYPERTROPHY.)</h3>

<p>The prostate gland lies just in front of the base of the bladder, and
surrounding the urethra, or urinary canal. Enlargement, therefore, of this
body, if it be of considerable extent, causes it to encroach and press upon
the base of the bladder, and to more or less constrict the urinary canal
near the base or outlet of the bladder. The enlargement may be only slight,
or the dimensions of the gland may be increased from the size of a large
chestnut, its normal dimension, to the volume of a pullet's egg, or even to
the size of an orange.</p>

<p>Hypertrophy of the prostate generally arises from causes which operate
in a slow and permanent manner. Whatever has a tendency to produce a
determination of blood to, and an engorgement of, this organ, is capable of
producing the affection, an augmented flow of blood to the the part having
the effect to increase the nutrition. Among the most frequent causes of
this affection, are excessive venery, masturbation, disease of the bladder,
stricture of the urethra, horseback exercise, gonorrhea, and the employment
of strong, stimulating diuretics. Some of the worst cases that we have had
to deal with have occurred in old men, and, in fact, the malady is more
common to those advanced in life; but it is frequently produced in those of
middle age by the causes enumerated.</p>

<p>Among the earliest symptoms of the disease is an uneasy feeling in the
region of the base of the bladder. There is a more frequent desire to
urinate than usual, and, in the course of time, this frequency becomes more
urgent; still no particular notice may be taken of it, it being considered
as "only a slight inconvenience." After several months, or it may be years,
the discomfort increases, and nightly calls to empty the bladder become
habitual. By and by the patient begins to find the discomfort of getting
out of his warm bed very troublesome; still no notice to taken of it. He
does not consider it worth his while to consult <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_841" id="Page_841"></a>[pg 841]</span>a doctor for "such a
trifle." In the course of time the patient is obliged to get out of bed
twice during the night instead of once. Afterwards, the calls become still
more frequent and urgent; the inconvenience more evident; finally, pain is
substituted for inconvenience, and then the doctor is consulted. Unless a
specialist of experience be consulted, the bladder will most probably be
examined, and medicine will be prescribed only to excite the kidneys to
secrete more urine, which does harm instead of good; the disease slowly,
but surely progressing. Patients often write us that they have had
something wrong with the bladder for a number of years, having to urinate
more frequently than they ought; sometimes having to do so three and four
times during the night; in extreme cases even every half hour or so, and
that they are not able to pass it freely, but only in small quantities, and
attended with much pain. These symptoms are not always constant, but let up
for a few weeks and then appear again. Things go on in this way for a year
or two, perhaps, when the passage of the urine is completely shut off for
several hours, and the patient is in great agony until the bladder is
relieved by the use of the catheter. After such instrumental relief, for a
day or two the urine may be natural again, coming at first, perhaps, in
very small quantities, but by and by more freely. Then, after a week or two
intervening, there may be another complete stoppage, attended, as before,
with intense suffering, which will have to be again relieved by the use of
an instrument.</p>

<p>The foregoing is a fair account of the usual progress of the disease and
its symptoms. As the prostate gland becomes more irritated and inflamed
from the natural progress of the disease, or from the irritation caused by
the passage of instruments, or the employment of strong, harsh, stimulating
diuretics, the urine becomes cloudy, and still later is found to have
deposited during the night in the chamber utensil a quantity of thick,
tenacious, and usually offensive mucus. There is apt to be more or less
discomfort in the rectum, or lower bowel, produced by the pressure of the
enlarged prostate upon it. Rarely, the first intimation of a large prostate
occurs through a sudden retention of the urine, and the patient being under
the impression that there was nothing wrong with the organ previously.
Closely questioned, however, the information is elicited that there has
been a long train of mild symptoms, similar to those that we have
described, preceding the attack of retention of the urine. This shows the
importance of early attention and proper treatment when such symptoms are
manifested. However slight the inconvenience experienced, it should not be
neglected. The disease should be brought under control at the outset by
skillful and nicely-adapted treatment. Usually before a person suffers from
toothache, the decay occasioning it has been gradually progressing without
pain for from five to eight years. Just as the decay of the tooth may be
arrested by the early attention of the dentist, so may prostatic disease by
early attention be not only promptly relieved, but permanently cured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_842" id="Page_842"></a>[pg
842]</span>Disease of the prostate being slow in its inception and
progress, is also slow to yield even to the most skillful treatment. Being
slow to develop, patients rarely seek assistance until the organ has become
so large as to be seldom restorable to a size where mechanical means can be
wholly dispensed with for relieving the bladder. Most surgeons are too much
in the habit of depending on the catheter for the relief of the patient,
and usually instruct the sufferer how to use it, telling them that this,
the catheter, is to be their only doctor for life. Great as is the relief
afforded by the catheter, which has often saved life, yet it is a fact that
its frequent and prolonged use often renders disease of the prostate very
intractable and often wholly incurable. Frequent use of the catheter,
without any treatment to prevent the further enlargement of the diseased
gland, or to reduce its size, permits the part to go on enlarging, and,
besides, the constant use of the catheter irritates the prostatic portion
of the urethra, causing thickening of the lining membrane, and sooner or
later a more or less complete organic stricture of this canal, depending
upon thickening of the lining mucous membrane, as well as upon the
encroachment of the gland itself upon this canal. Besides, when the use of
the catheter is once commenced, even when the enlargement is not very
great, it is with the utmost difficulty that we have been able to induce
patients to leave off its use. The bladder, becoming accustomed to its use,
refuses to obey the will without this help. The irritation set up in the
parts by the friction of the catheter causes inflammation and exudation in
the lining membrane. This extends to the structure of the prostate itself
and increases the hypertrophy or enlargement. It will, therefore, be seen
how important it is to early resort to treatment to relieve the first
manifestations of this affection. A disease of so delicate a nature, and
one so often confounded with other maladies by inexperienced physicians,
should only be intrusted for treatment to expert specialists of large
experience in the management of this and kindred maladies.</p>

<h1>STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA.</h1>


<p>Stricture of the urethra generally results from some specific disease of
the urethra, but may be caused by sexual excesses, exposure, or strain, or
by the practice of masturbation or self-abuse. It runs a course varying in
time from a few days to many weeks or months, during which time the patient
is often unaware of the real cause of his sufferings.</p>

<p>Commonly, the attention is first called to a stricture by a slight
discharge, or smarting sensation, or the appearance of an undue amount of
mucous deposit in the urine. Occasionally, some difficulty in starting the
water, or a diminution in the size and force, or a twisting of the stream
as it flows, is the first symptom. This passive stage is of variable
duration. When skillful treatment is instituted at this stage of the
disease, a speedy cure is easily effected without pain or danger. Any
exposure, improper use of instruments, or irritating cause, may speedily
give rise to the alarming symptoms due to closure of the urethra, from
which fatal consequences may suddenly ensue.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise616"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 2. A Single Stricture of the Urethra." src="images/advise616.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 2. A Single Stricture of the Urethra.</p>

<p>This condition is illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows the hard and tough
stricture which surrounds the soft mucous membrane that lines the urinary
canal. When irritated or inflamed, as the result of a cold or other cause,
the mucous membrane becomes swollen and thickened, and, as the stricture
will not yield and enlarge, the result is that the urethra is almost
completely closed, and it becomes impossible to pass the urine. Great pain
is experienced, and the surgeon has to be called to draw off the urine with
a catheter, which, at best, is a very difficult and painful operation, when
the urethra is so irritable and constricted.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In the earlier stages of the malady, relief is given
by the skillful use of instruments for dilating the canal, or, where this
fails by the operation of urethrotomy, for which we employ an improved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844"></a>[pg
844]</span>and ingenious instrument, by which the stricture is readily and
almost painlessly divided.</p>

<p><b>Improved Methods</b>. Our surgeons have operated upon many hundreds
of bad cases by a very ingenious and almost painless method, that requires
no use of bougies in the after-treatment. This saves the patient an immense
amount of pain and annoyance, and enables him to go home almost immediately
after the operation.</p>

<p>The ordinary after-treatment, by dilatation with bougies, is very
tedious, and often more painful than the operation itself, so that our
peculiar method of treatment has been hailed with joy by those familiar
with the old and unnecessarily-painful systems of treatment. Besides, our
more improved method has been followed by far more perfect cures in every
case operated upon.</p>

<p>In many of the cases coming under our observation and treatment, there
have been several strictures, as illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows the
urethra constricted at three different points, besides a congenital
contraction at its mouth or meatus.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise617"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 3. Condition of the Urethra with three Strictures and a congenital
contraction at the meatus or outlet." src="images/advise617.png" /></a><br
/>Fig. 3. Condition of the Urethra with three Strictures and a congenital
contraction at the meatus or outlet.</p>

<p><b>Spermatorrhea</b> not infrequently results from stricture of the
urethra, even when the affection is quite slight. Our attention was first
called to this subject by the consideration of the numerous cases in which
epileptic convulsions or "fits," and other serious diseases of the nervous
system in children, have resulted from an unnatural contraction of the
prepuce or foreskin, constituting what is termed <i>phimosis</i>.</p>

<p>Every surgeon of experience has met with many of these cases of reflex
irritation. It occurred to us, that, inasmuch as these contractions of the
foreskin give rise to nervous diseases of an alarming nature, may not an
unnatural narrowing of the urethral canal, which must have exactly the same
effect in retarding the flow of the urine, give rise to irritable nervous
affections in adults. May not unnatural irritation and excitement of the
sexual organs, so set up, cause loss of semen to occur during sleep, and
consequent nervous and general debility?</p>

<p>It is a well recognized fact that the urethral canal should bear a
certain <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845"></a>[pg
845]</span>definite and proportionate size to that of the penis, just as
the length of the arm should naturally bear a certain proportion to the
length of the body. In the case of some parts of the body, disproportionate
development of the part may not give rise to anything further than
unsightliness; but when we find the small size of the urethra retarding the
free passage of the urine, then we may expect, if this condition is long
continued, to find more or less irritation of the urethra and, perhaps, of
the bladder, also. When there is a contraction of the urethra at its
external orifice, or at any point along its course, unnatural pressure is
put upon the urinary canal behind the constricted portion, and these parts
must bear an undue strain during the passage of the urine.</p>

<p>It is a well established fact that improper diet, cold, exposure, and
over-work exert a very powerful modifying influence upon the urinary
secretion, frequently causing an acrid and irritating condition of this
fluid. This condition, when associated with a contracted urethra, must
result in irritation of the mucous membrane lining this canal back of the
stricture, if long continued or frequently repeated. As an illustration, we
have a hose pipe from which, by means of a small nozzle, water is expelled
a considerable distance, but a great tension is put upon the hose behind
the nozzle. If the pressure is increased greatly the hose will burst; but,
if the small nozzle be replaced with a larger one, the projection of the
stream will be quite as great, but all undue tension of the pipe is
overcome and the danger of bursting is done away with. We have, in an
unnaturally contracted urethra, a favorable condition for the development
of disease in the urinary canal and adjacent parts of the generative
organs. Irritation is set up in the urethra behind the stricture by undue
strain in passing water, and the frequent reoccurrence of acrid urine, as
the result of any of the causes we have already mentioned, this irritation
keeps gradually increasing. It will be felt more during the periods when
the urine is acrid, but may pass unnoticed even at such times. The seminal
sacs and the prostate and Cowper's glands communicate with the deeper
portions of the urethra by means of canals or ducts, lined with mucous
membrane which is continuous with the urethral mucous membrane. Hence we
can readily see that not only by reflex nervous irritation are those parts
debilitated, through the contraction of the urethra, but the affection is
apt to extend by continuity of the mucous membrane, and thus become more
and more manifest, through symptoms of disease of the testicles, prostate
gland and seminal vesicles, and these disorders become more and more seated
the longer the morbid condition of the urethra is allowed to run on, until
there may be an entire loss of the sexual functions, occurring at an age
when there should be present the most vigorous manhood. From no other cause
can we explain the common prevalence of disease of the deeper portions of
the urethral canal and bladder, many times confounded with other diseases
of the urinary and generative organs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846"></a>[pg

the foregoing statements:</p>


<p><b>Case 112,289. Mr. O.C.E., single, 32 years of age</b>.</p>

/></a><br />Fig. 4. Condition of the urethra in Case 112,289; permanently
cured at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.</p>

<blockquote><p></p>
He applied to us suffering from entire loss of the sexual function, with
great
nervous debility, and there was a thin slimy discharge from the urethra,
and the
usual symptoms of melancholia and weakness. He had lost all taste for
business,
and was extremely nervous, from the fact that he was engaged to be married,
and
felt that his condition would not permit it. On examination a contraction
of the
urethra was found at the point shown in Fig. 4, which had probably been
present
for years. He stated that he never had been just right in those parts, but
had lived
a virtuous life, had never had any venereal disease, and, hence, the true
nature of
his trouble had not been suspected. With the removal of the stricture there
was
an immediate improvement in his condition, which became more and more
rapid,
as his system gained strength and reaction became manifest. At the end of
two
months he wrote that he felt sound and well, and that he had experienced
the most
wonderful improvement in every way. His vital strength was fully restored,
and
he was most profoundly grateful.
</blockquote>


<p>Chronic inflammation of the bladder, sometimes called catarrh of the
bladder, an affection that is elsewhere herein fully treated of, and
chronic inflammation of the kidneys, and true Bright's disease, as well as
prostatic disease, are all liable to result from strictures of the urethra.
Hence, it behooves one suffering from this malady to have it promptly and
skillfully treated.</p>

<p><b>False Passages</b>. In very rare cases of impassable stricture, or in
which fistulous openings, or false passages, have formed, through which the
urine flows or dribbles away, we have resorted to the operation of perineal
section with the most gratifying results. The cases requiring this
operation are rare ones, in which death must generally result but for the
relief afforded by the operation.</p>

<p><b>Dangerous Use of Instruments</b>. The worst and most dangerous cases
of stricture with which we have met, in a long and extensive experience,
were rendered thus by the careless or unskillful use of bougies, catheters,
or sounds. Many surgeons and physicians are most recklessly careless or
unskilled in the use of these most dangerous instruments, as the many cases
of false passage or stricture of the most painful <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_847" id="Page_847"></a>[pg 847]</span>and dangerous kind, caused
or aggravated by their ignorant or improper use, sorrowfully testify.</p>

<p><b>Delay Dangerous.</b> By proper treatment of stricture in its early
stages, all danger and pain are avoided, and a cure is effected in a very
short time. In an extensive practice, in which we yearly treat hundreds of
cases, we have never yet failed to give perfect and permanent relief from
stricture, or diseased prostate or urethra, without the necessity of
cutting instruments of any kind, when we have been consulted before injury
of the urethra has been produced by improper use of instruments. Having
specialists who devote their entire time to the study and cure of these
diseases, we are thereby enabled to attain the highest degree of skill in
the management of these cases.</p>

<p><b>Great Skill Required</b>. The urethra is a sensitive and delicate
canal, and is surrounded by tissues the most delicate, and lined with
mucous membrane which is highly vascular and filled with sensitive nerves.
The introduction of any instrument is to be undertaken only when absolutely
required, and, when necessary, it should be so skillfully and carefully
effected that no pain or irritation can result. The slightest awkwardness
is liable to cause an unnoticeable injury, which results in false passage
or an effusion of plastic lymph around the canal, and as it organizes, the
formation of the most troublesome organic stricture. The attention not only
of sufferers, but also of the profession, is called to the remarkable
success of our operation, perineal section, by which a cure of extremely
bad cases of impassable stricture and false passages, or urinary fistulas,
is effected in from thirty to forty days, and with very little suffering.
That we have been successful in such cases must be considered as conclusive
evidence that no case of stricture, false passage, or urinary fistula, is
beyond the reach of our skill.</p>

<h1>TESTIMONIALS.</h1>

<p>In a practice embracing the treatment of a vast number of cases of
diseases of the Urinary Organs, it has been our good fortune to effect many
remarkable cures. The experience gained in this field of practice has made
our specialists skilled experts, and hence hundreds consult them as a last
resort. In fact we seldom get a case, in this line, that has not been the
rounds of the home physicians before applying to us for relief and cure.
The cures, therefore, which we shall introduce here are the more remarkable
because of the failure, in nearly every case, of other medical men to
benefit or cure. They are not the every-day, ordinary cases met with in the
general practitioner's rounds, but complicated, obstinate ones, which had
generally been given up as hopeless before coming to us.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I think it my duty to write to you concerning my case.
In the year 1886 I was seized with inflammation of the bladder and passed
nothing but thick blood, owing to heavy work, and I consulted a doctor and
he said there was no cure for such a bad case; but he gave me medicine and
it relieved me at the time I used it; and I took 16 bottles and I got worse
and wasted to a shadow. I quit taking the medicine, and other complaints
came, as rupture in the spermatic cord, for which I applied to you and soon
got relief. And in 1891 the bladder disease made its appearance, and I
wrote to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute and got no reply as our
mails were stopped on account of snow drifts. I sent for the best doctor in
Listowell and I still got worse, and he said I might live three or four
weeks, but there was no stoppage of the disease. And I got so weak that I
had to support myself by the furniture in my room; and I wasted down to 100
lbs. in two weeks; and I applied to your Institute and I received my
medicine in a few days, and in two weeks I began to gather strength and now
I am hearty and well and my weight is 145 lbs. I feel so thankful to the
Medical Association and its Staff of skilled men. It is 15 months since I
quit taking your medicines and no signs of the disease returning.</p>

that I was laid up for weeks at a time, and almost gave up in despair. I
was persuaded to go to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute. I have

<p>My disease was caused by the roughness and exposure incidental to the
life of a miner, working in the gold mines of California and Montana. I had
much of the time to work in water, with my clothes wet, which finally
brought on a severe pain In my kidney, which ere long completely prostrated
me. I employed and was treated by six different physicians, the best I
could obtain in my section of country, and who while seeming to understand
the nature of my disease, yet gave me no remedy that afforded me any real
relief. I grew worse under the treatment of them all. The pain in the
kidney left me, but immediately located in the bladder. My bladder became
very painful and commenced to ulcerate and fill up. It seemed from the
excruciating agony I suffered, that there must have been an abscess in
either the kidney or bladder, and from the large amount of pus discharged
at one time, it appeared to me that my kidneys, bladder and the entire
urinary organs were one mass of sores and pus mixed with blood. I had to
use injections of laudanum daily in the lower bowels to ease the pain and
live. Was reduced by long suffering, looking for each day to be my last. I
felt that no human power on earth could help me. No language can describe,
and God only knows, the agony I suffered. From what I have already written,
you may form some faint conception of my physical condition at the end of
six years' treatment by the best medical aid I could get in the section
where I was living. I also used for some time (with no benefit), "Warner's
Safe Cure," and in fact, tried every means that I could hear of, but to no
permanent relief. Such was my condition when I was led finally to consult
and be treated by your Association, though I had but faint hope of
obtaining any relief from any one. With the very best description I could
give in writing of my case, and all the information you got from me, you
would not undertake the case until you were further informed, and for which
caution I sincerely thank you. You wrote me&mdash;"we are at a loss to
definitely determine your condition. We have an opinion based upon the
facts before us, but we feel that we must have a personal examination." In
the condition I was then in, I could not have been kept alive to reach the
first railroad station, which was only six miles from my house, and much
less to travel to Buffalo. Indeed I wrote you, that if you would cure me
for nothing, I was unable to go to you. In reply, you then advised me to
take your "Special Remedies" until I could improve sufficiently to go to
Buffalo for examination. Now this frank answer of yours, removed every
doubt from my mind, and convinced me that you were <i>honorable
physicians</i>. On March 10th, 1883, I began taking your "Special
Remedies," as you prescribed them, and at the end of three years' constant
treatment, I was improved sufficiently to go to Buffalo to your Institute,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_850" id="Page_850"></a>[pg
850]</span>where I was examined as you required of me. When I reached your
Institute, I was there carefully examined and received a month's treatment.
When I reflect on my condition and my suffering when I first began to use
your specifics, and see what I am now, I feel that no words can too
glowingly express my gratitude to your Association for the physical
benefits you have conferred upon me by your treatment of my despaired-of
case.</p>

only speak in the highest terms of your Institution. After suffering for
ten or twelve years with retention of the urine, and bladder difficulties,
I can say that I found immediate relief at your hands. When going to your
place, about six years ago, I was suffering with intense pain, loss of
appetite, and unable to eat a good meal. I now weigh 170 lbs., do a good
day's work and feel well in every respect. I am only too glad that I am
able to praise your Institution, and can highly recommend it to any one who
is suffering as I was. With great respect, I remain.</p>

<p>Several years ago I had occasion to become an inmate of the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute, No. 683 Main Street, Buffalo, N.Y. I was
afflicted with an enlarged prostate and chronic Inflammation, or catarrhal
condition of the bladder. I was largely benefited by the treatment I
received there, and had I remained a little longer, as I was advised to do
by the doctor who attended me, I should have fully recovered. I was so
nearly cured that I did not think it necessary to remain longer, as I
supposed nature would do for me what remained to be done, to effect a
perfect cure. My business was urgent. I could not well remain longer. In
this I made a mistake, I should have remained longer. I was seventy-two
years old at the time. I bear willing testimony to the ability of the
medical staff and the interest the doctors take in the welfare of their
patients. The nurses and all the subordinates were very kind and seemed to
vie with each other to contribute to the pleasure and happiness of the
inmates of the Institute. One will find the Institute equipped with all the
improvements known to modern science, for the promotion and restoration of
health. It is impossible to do justice to its merits in a short article of
this kind. Persons must go there and see and judge for themselves, of the
wonders of this extraordinary medical establishment. If they cannot recover
their health there, in my Judgment, it is of no use to go elsewhere.</p>

say I found it fully equal in every respect to the claims made for it by
the proprietors. It was filled with invalids who were under the care of a
corps of physicians and surgeons and the fact that all the sick people
appeared to be improving, and that they were both cheerful and hopeful, and
that they all spoke well of the Institution and of its doctors, was
calculated to inspire confidence in one who went there himself to be
treated. The greater number of these cases, as far as I was able to learn,
were chronic and of a complicated character. They represented a wide range
of the States and Territories of the Union, and had in each exhausted the
resources of the home physicians. Having myself been treated by your
Faculty for a complication of troubles induced by exposure and malaria, I
feel that I owe my restoration to health to your skill and devotion, at a
time when I was unable to perform labor and was much discouraged, and had
failed to obtain relief elsewhere. You are at liberty to make any use you
may desire of this communication.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I received your kind letter the 12th, and was glad to
hear from you and have no objection to your making use of my name in any
way to help the sick and suffering, for I know what it is to be sick. I was
sick for seven years; could not do anything; was visited by seven doctors
and was treated by four, and was given up to die by one of the best doctors
of Russellville. He said I could not live longer than fall. He treated me
for Sugar Diabetes, while the rest said I had inflammation of the bladder.
After giving up all hopes of being cured at home, a friend got me to write
to Dr. Pierce's Institution and after corresponding: awhile I decided to go
and be treated. I was there one month and I never was cared for or treated
more kindly by any one. No parents could have been better to their sick
children. I cannot speak too highly of the Institution, and I believe I
would have been in my grave to-day if I had not gone and been treated.</p>

<p>I feel great pleasure in expressing to you my sincere thanks for the
cure that has been effected in my case, by your very skillful treatment,
whereby I am now entirely and I trust permanently cured from a dangerous
disease, which had defied the utmost skill of all former medical attendants
for the past five years, and from which I had despaired of being: relieved.
I am happy to state that my health is so good since taking the month's
course of treatment at your Institute, and, the home treatment since my
return, that I am now able to carry on the work of my farm.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I am seventy-seven years of age and have resided in
Erie for sixty-two years, and for thirty-six years have been an elder in
the First Presbyterian Church. During four or five years I suffered from a
painful affection of the bladder; the severity permitted neither freedom
from pain by day nor calm repose by night. Meanwhile, I consulted leading
physicians and visited numerous health resorts. Neither time, means nor
effort were spared that I might be free from pain. Relief came
unexpectedly. A signal act of Providence, that should be acknowledged
daily, brought your Institution to my notice, though I had then no
acquaintance with any one connected with it. With me it was a question of
life or death. Up to last March I was in a condition of unendurable
torture. I knew that at my age, after the months of pain already borne,
that any operation would be serious, perhaps fatal. Accordingly, I arranged
my temporal affairs and carefully "set my house in order." On the 13th of
March last, I started for Buffalo to your Institution. Still uninformed as
to the cause of my trouble, I submitted to a searching examination, as to
my habits, constitution, parentage, the age and cause of death of my
parents, and other facts, from which a tolerable biography could have been
prepared. All was kindly intended. Their aim was to locate my ailment and
then to determine my ability to undergo an operation. Having found a stone
in the bladder, they advised that it be crushed and extracted. By a strange
coincidence as this was announced, I learned of Col. Elliott F. Shepard's
death under an operation for the same disease. He was many years my junior,
and seemingly far better able to undergo the operation. Still, in my
desperation, I determined to go on. During five days, I was under treatment
for the coming operation. On the 18th of March the stone was crushed and
extracted. It was a complete success. Of the consideration, tenderness and
skill of the surgeon and his assistants, I cannot too strongly speak. Of
the gentle and assiduous nurses, the system and completeness of the whole
establishment, as it moved along as one harmonious whole, in all its
departments, I cannot sufficiently express my admiration. I am now relieved
of a state of torture, and restored to health and happiness equal to any
period of my life. This I say with sincerity and emphasis. Since then I
have gained twenty-two pounds in flesh. I wish my words could reach the ear
of every one similarly affected, throughout our land, to banish all doubts
and take advantage of the science, skill and pleasant surroundings so
happily blended in your Institution, for the removal of pain and the
mitigation of distress.</p>

accomplished in my case. For ten years I was a sick man, and during three
years I suffered so much that life was a burden. My business had to be
given up and the torments were something that could not be described. Every
little while I had to urinate, and each time suffered a spasm of pain, like
a knife thrust; the use of a catheter was painful and often it took long
and painful trials before the water could be drawn off. I passed blood, in
quantities at times. When I went to your place we had given up hope of a

me. I spent four weeks in your Invalids' Hotel, and now at the age of

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;Seeing the picture of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute in our local newspapers, called to my mind the treatment I
received there in 1887. I had been suffering for ten or twelve years with
bladder trouble, and our home physicians did not seem to understand the
cause or the trouble, and I finally corresponded with your faculty, and
their advice was to come and have an examination. I had been a great
sufferer and was so weak that I could hardly walk from the hotel to the
depot, and those who saw me start said that I would be brought home in a
box. Soon after my arrival an examination revealed a stone in my bladder.
After a few days' treatment to strengthen up the system, the stone was
taken out, weighing 530 grains. Four or five others were afterwards taken
out of smaller size, and I am still alive. Will soon be seventy-six years
old, and I cannot speak too highly of the care and attention I received
from the physicians and nurses while there. Everything that was provided
was of the best; good food, glean apartments; and no better place can be
found for treatment of the many diseases they advertise to cure.</p>

<p>I would not be a true man If I did not acknowledge at this time (as I
should have done long ago), with words of gratitude, the wonderful relief I
received at your Institution five years ago. It affords me the greatest
pleasure to say to you and to the world at large, that the treatment and
operation I received at your Institution was an entire success and a
miraculous cure. After twenty-five long years of suffering such as few
people endure, caused from exposure while in the military service of the
United States, I contracted kidney and bladder disease, which shortly
afterwards resulted in the formation of a calculus or stone. I experimented
with medicines. Special Prescriptions, etc., from some of the most eminent
physicians in the world, in fact everything that promised relief and help
for my kidneys was used, but received no relief, until the bladder
discomfort became unendurable. As a last resort, knowing full well that
life with me would be very short unless I could receive immediate relief, I
went to your famous Institute, where I was treated and operated upon and a
large stone was removed from the bladder. The old method of cutting, which
is so dangerous, was not employed, but the new and painless process of
crushing; this process was an agreeable surprise to me, no pain and no
risk, as in the old method of cutting. From the day of the operation I
began to improve, and in a few weeks thereafter I returned home to my wife,
family and friends, a well and happy man, and I have spent the last five
years with ease, comfort and pleasure&mdash;a living, walking testimonial for
your renowned Institute. Believe me, when I say that words fail me to
express to you my sincere gratitude for your marvelous and almost
miraculous cure effected in my case. I feel sure no invalid could receive
more skillful and kindly attention anywhere in the world. I would urge
every sufferer to take treatment at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute, believing it to be the most skillful, and feel sure that it is
the most advanced of the age.</p>

<p>From severe exposure when in the army, I brought upon myself an acute
attack of rheumatism, from which I suffered terrible pain. Following this I
began to be troubled with my bladder and kidneys. For three years I
experienced considerable discomfort. There was severe burning and scalding,
and urination caused much pain. I passed two pieces of gravel and became
convinced that I had stone in the bladder. Was examined by my home
physician, who said there was no stone. I was not satisfied, however, and
went to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute. I was examined by their
specialist. After an injection of cocaine and carefully cleansing out the
bladder, a stone was found about one inch and a half in diameter, probably
similar in its composition to the pieces already passed. I was advised to
have it operated upon and removed, which I arranged to do. The process used
was their new and painless one of crushing, no knife or other cutting
instrument being employed. The stone was readily grasped by the crusher and
reduced to small fragments. The evacuator was then introduced and the stone
entirely removed. After a few weeks' careful attention my health was
entirely restored and I was able to leave for home. I take great pleasure
in making public my wonderful cure. I could not speak in too high praise of
those who took charge of my case, nor recommend too highly this famous
Institution. It is about three years since I was operated on, and pave not
felt any bad effects since.</p>

had been cured by the specialists, who had before been given up to die by

stubborn one. I afterwards saw a man here, in Georgia, die, who, if he had
been in Pierce's Surgical Institute under the treatment and care of his

Because it was only a case of <i>stone in the bladder</i>, and they are

across a beam, striking upon the perineum. A physician was immediately
called and I was treated by him for about eight or ten weeks. A catheter
was introduced into the bladder, but caused such intense pain and anguish
that it had to be withdrawn. It was tried again but could not be introduced
on account of the lacerations in the urethra, caused by the violence used.
A consultation was held and an operation recommended. An an&aelig;sthetic
was used and a cut made through the perineum from the outside into the
bladder. A catheter was inserted into the bladder, tied in place and left
in position for about eight weeks. After eight or nine weeks the catheter
was removed, but it was four or five weeks before the wound in the perineum
healed. After a few months I began to have a urinary difficulty, and
symptoms of urethral stricture. This condition continued until the urethra
was entirely closed, and it was impossible to make water. A physician
attempted to pass a catheter, but could not do so. He continued to treat me
by the process of dilation for five or six months. I began to feel more
comfortable, but the symptoms of stricture would manifest themselves again.
I then went to a hospital at Toronto. There I was treated also by the
dilating method. The treatment was continued for about four weeks, but
became so very painful, and there was so much irritation in the urethra,
that it was impossible to endure it longer. They then called an electrical
specialist and he began treatment by electrolysis. In about three weeks I
went home, but in a short time the stricture again manifested itself; the
contraction was very marked, and micturition very difficult. It grew
gradually worse and I could not receive any comfort or benefit. I returned
to Toronto to take further treatment from the electrical specialist. During
the operations of dilation of the urethra, I passed some gravel. After four
weeks treatment I returned home, but in about two months was as bad as
ever, and last October went back to Toronto and was again treated by the
electrical method. The doctor had much difficulty in inserting the smallest
catheter, and it caused intense pain and suffering. The last time he
attempted to insert a catheter, there seemed to be something give way, and
a large amount of pus and fluid passed from the rectum. The physician told
me an abscess had formed. I returned home and tried to keep as comfortable
as possible, but could not micturate with any degree of satisfaction or
comfort. I gradually began to grow worse and there was a return of the
stricture with inflammation of the bladder. In March, 1892, there began to
be formed gravel in the bladder. They would at times obstruct the flow of
urine entirely. I kept going from bad to worse, until the urethra appeared
to be entirely closed. The physician I called found it impossible to pass a
catheter Into the bladder, and advised me to go to some hospital where I
could receive proper treatment, and where proper appliances for this class
of cases were used, as he felt satisfied nothing could be accomplished for
me at home. I then came to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute in
Buffalo to receive treatment, and the treatment has been so successful that
the urethral stricture as well as the gravel have been removed. After I
returned home I felt as if a great load had been lifted from my shoulders.
I have no irritation at all as I used to have, and I can keep my water for
six or seven hours without any trouble, and the water seems to be clear and
free from sediment of any sort, and in general I feel as I never expected
to again. The doctors here were dumb-founded at the short time I was in
getting fixed at your Institution, and feel ashamed to ask any questions as
to treatment. Many months have passed and I continue well and active in my
profession. Any one I can send the way of your Institution you may be sure
I shall do so, and thanking you personally for your kind and successful
treatment of my case,</p>

<p>The stricture, which resulted from an injury, had been greatly
aggravated by uric acid crystals which were continually forming in the
urine. Patient had rheumatism, causing this acid state of the system. He
had been a great sufferer for many years, continually experiencing the
nervousness, smarting, pain and burning, with occasional attacks of
urethritis, common to the malady in this form. This made the stricture
almost unbearable, and he was practically incapacitated for his labor at
the time that treatment was undertaken in our Institution. He had been to
the Hot Springs and in the care of other physicians with no satisfactory
results. The relief of the stricture by our new and painless method was
followed by very great improvement in his condition, after which
appropriate remedies for the rheumatism were administered, and the result
was a very gratifying and satisfactory relief from his difficulty. Patient
afterwards embarked in business as a proprietor of a hotel of his own, and
has been ever since very active in carrying on the business, and extremely
successful. The stricture showed no tendency to recur, as is commonly the
case where it is cured by other methods than employed by us. Many years

<p>In September, 1886, I was examined by one of your able staff of
physicians and was found to be suffering with a bad form of nasal catarrh
and with two strictures in the urethra (water passage). After a few days'
general treatment, I was operated upon and turned over to be cared for by
the nurse, from whom I received all the attention that was necessary. To my
utter astonishment I was dismissed in twenty days from the Surgical
Institute, cured of the stricture. I had been operated on by one able
surgeon of Nashville, Tenn., and was worse after the operation than before.
I have never had a symptom of the stricture since I was dismissed from the
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, and have been in better health than
ever before in my life.</p>

in the bladder. The discomfort increased, until it almost became
unbearable. Hearing of the universal success of the specialist at the
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, in similar cases, I went there and
submitted to an operation. The method employed was their new and painless
one of crushing, no knife or cutting instrument being used. I felt no pain
afterward, there was no fever, and I could have gone home the day after.
The operation was witnessed by one of my friends, who says it was very

been troubled in the least, although nearly seven years have passed.</p>

<h1>RUPTURE.</h1> <h2>(BREACH OR HERNIA.)</h2>


<p>By the term <i>Hernia</i>, we mean a tumor, which is formed by the
displacement of the intestines, the omentum (covering of the bowels), or
both, and which protrudes from the abdominal cavity. The most common
varieties are <i>umbilical, inguinal</i> and <i>femoral</i> hernia.
Children are most subject to umbilical, males to inguinal, and females to
femoral, hernia.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise651"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 1. Indirect Inguinal Hernia." src="images/advise651.png" /></a><br
/>Fig. 1. Indirect Inguinal Hernia.  Sketched from a case subsequently
cured by our improved method of treatment. </p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. These are either <i>predisposing</i> or <i>exciting</i>.
Any thing which occasions general or local muscular debility, as dropsy,
pregnancy, abscesses, wounds, obstructions to natural evacuations, etc., is
a predisposing cause of hernia. The exciting cause is pressure applied to
the contents of the abdomen, as straining in evacuating the bowels and
bladder, lifting heavy weights, or violent physical exertion.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The only characteristic symptom of hernia is the
presentation of an elastic, or doughy tumor of variable size, which either
gradually or suddenly makes its appearance. There is flatulence,
uneasiness, and sometimes pain in the abdomen.</p>

<p>Sharp and dull pains frequently recurring and confined to the locations
where ruptures appear should receive attention. Examination will not
infrequently reveal a small enlargement. If a hernia, this will usually
disappear after a night's rest and may not be again noticed until the next
day, or for several days. On <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_863"
id="Page_863"></a>[pg 863]</span>coughing, with the finger applied to the
enlargement, a sensation of an impulse (succussion), or slight additional
protrusion will be felt</p>

<p>The trouble appears at any time of life, an analysis of seventy thousand
cases indicating that it is most common in debilitated persons, and that
there is a constant decrease in the frequency of the affection from the
first to the thirteenth year, after which rupture is more and more
frequently met with as age advances.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise652"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 2.  This figure illustrates a case of Femoral Hernia "
src="images/advise652.png" /></a><br />Fig. 2.  This figure illustrates a
case of Femoral Hernia which was radically cured by our improved method.
This tumor is a little lower on the thigh than in cases of inguinal hernia.
Femoral Hernia is most common to females, and inguinal in males.</p>

<p><b>Inguinal Hernia</b> (see Fig. 1) is more common than all other forms
of rupture. It is more frequently met with in men, and when severe there is
usually a mass of intestine which falls into the scrotum and has an evil
effect, by pressing upon the testicle. The protrusion follows the spermatic
vessels and hence it usually appears low down in the abdomen and on one or
both sides of the pubic bone.</p>

<p><b>Femoral Hernia</b> (see Fig. 2), most common in women of mature life,
is felt as a lump below the strong ligament in the groin which forms the
line of separation between the thigh and the abdomen. On its outer side and
close to it can be felt the beating or pulsation of the large artery of the
thigh.</p>

<p><b>Umbilical Hernia</b> (see Fig. 3) appears at or near the navel and is
most common in children. It may be present from birth, or it may result
from fretting and crying at any period of childhood.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise653"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 3.  UMBILICAL HERNIA." src="images/advise653.png" /></a><br />Fig. 3.
UMBILICAL HERNIA.  Sketched from a case subsequently cured by our new
method.</p>

<p>Sufferers from any form of rupture are constantly subject to <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_864" id="Page_864"></a>[pg 864]</span>the
danger of strangulation. This occurs when, from any cause the free return
of the contents of the protruded part of the intestine is prevented. It is
an accident of a serious nature, inasmuch as nearly fifty per cent. die if
not carefully operated upon, and with the most skillful treatment, one in
four cases terminates in death.</p>

<p>Every individual should guard against rupture by maintaining, by proper
exercise, diet, and rest, a condition of vigor and tonicity of the muscular
system.</p>

<p>When debilitated, all strains and exertions should be care fully avoided
until the health is built up, and the relaxation overcome.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The palliative treatment of hernia is by
<i>reduction</i> and <i>retention</i>. Reduction consists in returning the
protruding intestine to its proper place through the opening by which it
escaped. This is accomplished either by manipulation or by a surgical
operation. Retention is effected by wearing a mechanical appliance called a
<i>truss</i>.</p>

<p>As soon as the tumor protrudes, or the "bowel comes down," the patient
should assume the recumbent posture, with his shoulders and feet elevated.
The patient or an attendant should grasp the hernia, and with gentle, but
gradually increasing pressure upon the tumor attempt to replace it. At the
same time let the patient knead the bowels upward by pressing upon the
integument, so that the intestine may, as far as possible, be pushed away
from the point of protrusion. Sometimes the contraction of the muscular
fibres at a point where the hernia makes its exit is so great that the
tumor cannot be replaced. In this case the system should be relaxed with
lobelia (not given in doses <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_865"
id="Page_865"></a>[pg 865]</span>to produce vomiting), and as soon as the
patient is thoroughly under its influence, the manipulations may be
resumed. When there is any difficulty experienced in putting back the
"breach," or rupture, professional assistance should be promptly summoned.
After the reduction of the rupture, a truss should be properly adapted,
applied, and constantly worn, to prevent the protrusion of the
intestine.</p>

<p>Of the latter instruments there are several hundred varieties for sale
throughout the country. With the exception of about one-half dozen forms,
which embody the true principles of a proper truss, they are, without
exception, harmful. Unless proper support be given to the walls of the
abdomen, and that without constant pressure, a truss does harm; then, too,
the shape of the pad must be such as to avoid pressure where it is not
required; otherwise, as in the case where a small ring is worn upon a
finger, there is a gradual loss of strength and a depression formed in the
healthy tissue, which can be plainly seen and felt. In this way trusses do
harm, and such evil consequences may follow the <i>improper</i> application
of a <i>good</i> truss.</p>

<p><b>Surgical Treatment</b>. When the hernia has become strangulated and
cannot be returned by manipulation, a surgical operation is necessary.
Whenever the necessity for such a procedure is apparent, it should be
performed <i>immediately</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_866"
id="Page_866"></a>[pg 866]</span>for the greater the delay the greater the
liability to fatal results. The operation consists in cutting down upon the
strangulated bowel, thus relieving it of its constriction and facilitating
its replacement. It is a delicate operation, and must be skillfully
performed. After the operation, the patient requires appropriate hygienic
treatment.</p>

Double Inguinal Hernia, of large size, which was permanently cured by our
improved method of treatment. The left side (<i>b</i>) shows the
<i>direct</i> descent of the bowel into (<i>c</i>) the scrotum, while on
the right side (<i>a</i>) the rupture is indirect, the bowel descending
through the internal ring and inguinal canal.</p>

<p><b>The Radical Cure</b>. A small percentage of cures will follow the
proper use of a good truss, and the advertisements of the so-called rupture
cures are founded upon such cases. These impostors pretend that the use of
some vaunted salve, ointment, or styptic lotion, applied on the outside,
will heal and cure the deep-seated separation of the muscular fibres. The
truss in these cases is the curative means in the small number that are
relieved, and for it but few dollars should be charged instead of the
exorbitant prices demanded by these impostors.</p>

<p>Improvements in surgery in this age of wonders, have kept apace with the
advances in electricity and other branches of science. Diseases and
deformities which only a few years ago were considered incurable are now
overcome and cured with certainty and without risk or suffering. Especially
is this true with reference to hernia or rupture.</p>

<p>Our specialists have devoted much attention to the radical cure of
rupture, or breach, with the most gratifying results. Formerly we employed
and advocated the use of the injection treatment only. This method was
tested and brought to a most efficient and practical stage, so that we now
apply it in the treatment of over eighty per cent. of the cases that are
presented at our Institution. This plan of cure, as used by us, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_867" id="Page_867"></a>[pg 867]</span>is a
great advance over that of any similar one in use, throughout the country.
Our fluid is much more safe in its effects, never gives rise to the
troublesome abscesses and inflammation that is common to the use of the
injection fluids that have been advised on the Heatonian method. The fluid
we use is a bland and healing agent, which produces an exudation behind the
cords that surround the inguinal rings, and forms a well defined truss pad
of moderate size in such position that the rupture cannot pass by it and
appear externally. It causes also an adhesive inflammation limited to the
hernial sac, that completely closes it.</p>

<p>This treatment is rendered <i>entirely painless</i> by the use of a
solution which is injected underneath the skin with a fine hollow needle
attached to a small syringe, and which tends to produce complete local
an&aelig;sthesia, or loss of feeling so that the procedure is thoroughly
and carefully carried out without any risk or discomfort.</p>

<p>The needle used by us for the treatment of the hernia is so perfected
that any possible injection of the fluid into the abdominal cavity, or upon
the coating of the intestine, is an impossibility, and in no way can an
injection be made into a blood vessel or nerve so as to produce any
discomfort or trouble. We thus avoid all the risks that pertain to the
usual plan of injection.</p>

<p>There is a small percentage of cases, as before stated, in which this
form of treatment is not likely to give a permanent cure, from the fact
that the omentum or intestine has become adherent externally, to the sac,
or in the scrotum, to the coverings of the testicle. This makes the
complete replacement of the rupture without cutting an impossibility, and
in such cases even where the hernial opening is closed, treatment by
injection only would not result in a permanent cure.</p>

<p>Our aim is to treat all cases of rupture that we undertake in such a
manner that <i>by no possibility can the deformity return</i>. We therefore
have for the cure of these cases another method, by which with our local
an&aelig;sthetic fluid, we are able to perform a surgical operation without
any distress whatever to the patient. The greatest risk of the old
operation for rupture was the danger of general an&aelig;sthesia with
chloroform or ether, or <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_868"
id="Page_868"></a>[pg 868]</span>some similar agent. The great majority of
individuals cannot bear the inhalation of the large quantities of these
an&aelig;sthetics necessary to secure loss of feeling without consequent
nausea, and at times an effect upon the heart that often results seriously.
The risk from the an&aelig;sthetic is much greater than from the surgical
procedure. By our method, this risk is entirely done away with. The pain
dispelling fluid enables our operator to pursue his method <b>without
giving the patient any pain or discomfort whatever</b>. During the
operation he is in full possession of all his faculties, and can assist in
any way desired by coughing, or straining, in order, at any time, to
complete the protrusion of the rupture and show its entire extent of
surface when the sac is laid bare. We then replace the rupture completely;
suture the sac so that the rupture will have no pocket into which to
descend, and then firmly unite the rings by a plan that we have invented,
and <b>by which they are made more strong and firm than in their original
state</b>.</p>

<p>Early in our experience, and while using the plan of treatment that is
usually employed for the radical cure of rupture, we had occasional
relapses of the difficulty, but since using our improved method we have had
no such trouble. We can assure our patients that there is less risk of the
appearance of the rupture at the point where the operation is performed
than there is of a new breach forming. The success of this treatment has
been invariable. None of the plans of treatment that we pursue for the cure
of rupture tend to keep the patient in bed more than a few hours. There is
little or no pain, after either of our plans of treatment, and out of the
many hundreds which we have treated and perfectly cured, in no instance
have we had any inflammation or serious manifestation&mdash;there being no fever
or general reaction. It is a matter of great surprise to our patients, who
undergo our treatment for the radical cure of rupture, that by our varied
methods, the object is accomplished with so little discomfort and with no
pain whatever.</p>

<p>From two to three weeks' personal attention of our specialist, is
usually all that is required even in the worst cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_869" id="Page_869"></a>[pg

cured only when the patient is able to do without a truss or support in all

still, have always worked along with them until this winter. One side was
of twenty-five years' standing&mdash;the other of about eight years. This winter
I was laid up sick with pneumonia; in coughing so much, which of course was
made necessary by that terrible disease, I strained myself so that after
getting up from my sick-bed, I was not able to go to work, as I could get
no truss that would hold the rupture. I was talking with Brother Stagg one
day. He asked me "why I did not go to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute, at Buffalo, N.Y., and get cured?" I went, and in three weeks was
cured, so that I could dispose of my truss entirely.</p>

your long list as <i>very remarkable</i>. I had a rupture of twenty-seven
years' standing, with hemorrhage of the kidney for six months, preceding my
visit to your Institute, and was also troubled badly with indigestion, all
of which ailments had reduced me in strength and flesh to a mere skeleton.
Had been treated by many local physicians, who failed to do me any good. I
could walk but a very short distance when I left my home on the 8th of
July, 1892, for treatment at your Institution, with but little faith or
hope of ever being any better. But through your skillful treatment I was
able to return to my home on the 9th of August, 1892, and consider myself
permanently cured, having had to take no medicine since. Considering my
case <i>almost a miracle</i>, I cannot speak too highly of your Institute
and skillful treatment, to which I feel that I am indebted for my continued
existence. You are at liberty to refer to me, and to use this as you see
fit.</p>

caused by heavy lifting. It was on the right side and the protrusion
sufficient to extend into the scrotum. I purchased trusses, but none of
them could be worn with comfort, and I suffered very much. I concluded to

<p>In the year 1883, I became ruptured on the <i>left</i> side. I
immediately wrote you (having heard of your fame in curing all kinds of
diseases) for your terms of treatment which I received by return mail, you
also stating you were positive you could cure me. Through unavoidable
circumstances I was unable to come to your Institution until December,
1886. During this time I had tried wearing a truss, which only made it
worse, and very much aggravated my complaint as it was impossible to hold
the rupture in its place. However I arrived at the Invalids' Hotel on
December 8th, 1886. On being examined by one of your staff, I was
pronounced a bad case, but by your mode of treatment you could cure it. I
was therefore, operated upon by one of your specialists, without any
cutting however and comparatively little pain, by your scientific method,
and in thirty days returned home cured. The time I had to remain there, I
believe, was much longer than most persons treated for the same
complaint.</p>

<p>Since then I have worked very hard sometimes (my occupation being that
of a farmer,) so much so that I became ruptured on the <i>right</i> side
three years ago,&mdash;the other side remaining perfectly sound without any
protection. I considered myself very unfortunate in being in this position
again, fortunate in knowing where to go for relief, and very soon was back
in your Institution where I was successfully treated and perfectly cured
and am to-day a sound man and able to do any kind of work on my farm.</p>

<p>I write this testimonial for the sake of suffering humanity, and wish
you to use it in any way that the greatest number of persons may read it.
As for myself, I would not be in the condition I once was and not know of
your Institution for all I could see. I not only recommend your Institution
for the complaint of which I was cured but for all chronic diseases or
anything requiring a skillful surgical operation, believing your Staff of
Physicians and Surgeons to be second to none anywhere. Your nurses and
attendants, and every accommodation, also, being all that is necessary to
make your Institution everything that its name implies&mdash;a complete Invalids

<p><i>Dear Sirs</i>&mdash;Our boy is, since the operation, quite well and
healthier than ever before, so that I presume, the rupture, or a part of
it, may have existed since his birth. Even that small lump in the groin
has, as much as I can feel by touching, completely disappeared. I take this

men. Dr. Pierce's Invalids' Hotel of Buffalo, N.Y., deserves to be
recommended to every sufferer of whatever disease. Eight years ago I
underwent a successful operation, saving my body a member. The dangerous
outgrowth, which made the operation a necessity, never returned. In regard
to your specialist, I wish to remark, that his skillful way of performing
operations reminded me very much of Bernard von Langenbeck, professor of
surgery in the University of Berlin, where I was a student. He is just as
tender and sympathetic with his patients as that famous director of the
Prussian Royal Clinical Hospital has been. As to the medicines of Dr.
Pierce, I recommended them to members of my congregation, who told me that
they did them good. Dr. Bastian, of Dansville, N.Y., a druggist, told me
that your medicines are bought by the same persons again and again. I
consider this to be the best recommendation. A medicine which is of no
effect will not be bought a second time by the same person.</p>

kindly make inquiry in regard to my physical condition, I would say, that I
am now, I think, as sound as a dollar, and consider that after I had bad
fourteen years of suffering with Hernia, and being cured as I was last

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I take pleasure in reporting that I have not worn the
truss for a long period, and that I have been at work steadily at my
business of binding and printing, running a large establishment, for over
four years, without any trouble whatever from the rupture. It has remained
permanently and perfectly cured. You will remember my case as a most severe
one. I am a man of sixty years of age, and the disease had been the source
of serious discomfort to me since childhood. The protrusion was the size of
a man's head, and could not be replaced. I was forced to give up all
exercise, and suffered much at my daily work from inconvenience and pain.
Any injury upon the protrusion, which could not always be protected, was
followed with much discomfort, and my general health was seriously
affected. The passage of the food through the confined intestines was a
painful process often times, and kept me in great misery. I am thankful to
state that since your operation the rupture has remained sound and well,
and I have been relieved of all difficulty of the kind. I now enjoy
excellent health, and am at my business daily from twelve to sixteen hours,
and on my feet constantly, yet without any manifestations whatever of the
re-appearance of the rupture. You have my most sincere gratitude for the
skillful operation and the good care received in your Institution while
there. I can recommend your nurses and physicians most highly, and think
your Institution is unequaled in this country.</p>

cure for the benefit of all those persons who have suffered in like manner.
I had a rupture that was very large and difficult to hold in place. Trusses
of all kinds were tried. They were painful and would not hold it. The
rupture would come down constantly when at my engine and give me fearful

<h4>"A LIVING DEATH FOR YEARS."</h4>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;In the hope that some sufferer from hernia may be
induced to take your treatment for that disease, I send you this
certificate, containing a synopsis of my case and cure of the same. My life
was a living death for years. I had almost lost all hope of ever being
cured, and was plunged in despair, as I had tried so many trusses,
appliances and remedies, each one in successive repetition, a failure. In
January and February of the year '89, I entered your Institution for
treatment, my malady being an inguinal hernia on the right side, of twenty
years' standing&mdash;from childhood. I was then impressed with the feeling that
it was my last chance, and that it would be my last effort, and to be
candid I had very little hope that a cure would be effected. To me my
condition seemed appalling, as I dare not eat, drink, laugh, exercise or
perform any of the functions of life without having to reduce my rupture,
frequently as often as forty or fifty times <i>per diem</i>, while on
occasions the reduction would occupy hours of untold agony. No truss or
appliance that I could get would retain the rupture, and I had tried all
sorts as fast as they came to my knowledge. Marvelous as it may appear to
all sufferers from this distressing affliction, I was discharged from your
Institute in thirty days, a well and sound man, and only from memory and
the record do I know that I was ever ruptured. I have at times since
performed some of the hardest kinds of work for long periods, but no sign
of weakness has ever appeared. I do not consider the necessary operation
performed as attended with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_877"
id="Page_877"></a>[pg 877]</span>any danger; it is no comparison to the
chances a person takes who in the daily walks of life is tortured with a
rupture.</p>

<p>While an inmate of your Institution, I was accorded the kindest and most
considerate treatment from all members of your staff and employees with
whom I came in contact. I consider the appointments and cuisine of the
establishment as perfection. You are at liberty to make the fullest and
freest use of this testimonial you may see fit in your judgment, and I will
cheerfully answer any communication from any sufferer referred to me for
more explicit testimony.</p>

<h2>CROUP, MEMBRANOUS AND SPASMODIC.</h2>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise678"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 1. False Membrane in Croup. From a specimen in Dr. Gross' cabinet."
src="images/advise678.png" /></a><br />Fig. 1. False Membrane in Croup.
From a specimen in Dr. Gross' cabinet.</p>

<p>Every family should be made acquainted with the symptoms and treatment
of this disease. Especially is this true in the case of those living remote
from a physician. From the lack of this knowledge on the part of parents,
many a little one has perished before medical assistance could be obtained.
In some of its forms its progress is very rapid, and, unless relief is
obtained in a few moments, or hours at the most, death ensues.</p>

<p>There are several quite distinct pathological conditions of the vocal
and respiratory organs which have, in popular parlance, been designated as
croup. But two of these are worthy of consideration here. These are
<i>true</i> or <i>membranous</i> croup, in which a false, semi-organized
membrane is formed, and <i>spasmodic croup</i>. Both may result fatally,
but the former is much the more dangerous.</p>

<p><b>Membranous Croup</b> is supposed to originate in the trachea, from
which, as it progresses, it often extends upward to the larynx, and
downward to the bronchial tubes. It is the result of severe inflammation of
the mucous membrane, and is characterized by the formation of a false
membrane, which covers or lines the inner surface of the true structure
(see Fig. 1). It is formed of a coagulable, semi-fluid exudation from the
mucous membrane. On being brought to the surface and into contact with the
inspired air, this substance grows thick and tough, or leathery, as we find
it. It is the obstruction in the respiratory canal which this foreign
matter causes that gives rise to the labored breathing, and the ringing,
brassy cough, together with the crowing or whistling inspiration
characteristic of croup. Before recovery can take place this membrane must
be detached and expelled. The cough is nature's effort to accomplish this
work.</p>

<p>The formation of this adventitious membrane in the larynx is attended
with more danger than when it is confined to the trachea. In most cases in
which the disease has had a very speedily fatal termination, an examination
has shown that the larynx was its chief seat.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. True croup is generally preceded by what is known as "a
cold." The child coughs, sneezes, and is hoarse. It is the hoarseness and
the peculiar <i>character</i> of the cough which indicate the tendency to
croup. This has been already described. In addition, the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_879" id="Page_879"></a>[pg 879]</span>child
is restless, fretful and feverish. The disease makes rapid strides. Finally
the cough ceases to be loud and barking, and is very much suppressed; the
voice is almost gone; the face is very pale; the head thrown back; the
nostrils dilated and in perpetual motion, the pulse at the wrist very
feeble, great exhaustion, more or less delirium, and, finally, death comes
to the relief of the little sufferer. Convulsions sometimes occur in the
last stages, and soon terminate fatally.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. No time should be lost in commencing treatment. Hot
fomentations should be applied to the throat and upper portions of the
chest. The free inhalation of steam should be employed early. The following
treatment has been found very effectual in membranous croup, and is
recommended by the highest authorities: Yellow subsulphate of mercury, or
turpeth mineral, three to five grains, depending upon the age of the child,
for one dose. If it does not cause vomiting in fifteen minutes, give a
second dose. This, however, is seldom necessary. If the turpeth mineral
cannot be obtained, sulphate of copper or sulphate of zinc may be given
instead, as directed under the head of Emetics, in Part III, Chapter II. If
there be a quick pulse, hot skin, a hurried breathing, and an occasional
ringing cough, the child should be kept in bed, comfortably covered, but
not overloaded with clothes, and the tincture or fluid extract of veratrum
viride administered as follows: Take fluid extract of veratrum, five drops;
sweet spirits of nitre, one teaspoonful; pure water, twenty teaspoonfuls;
mix, sweeten with white sugar, and give a teaspoonful of the mixture every
half-hour to two hours, according to the age of the child and the severity
of the case. If there be great prostration, with cold extremities, the
carbonate of ammonia should be administered, in doses of from one to two
grains, every second hour, in gum arabic mucilage. Quinine is a valuable
remedy, and is tolerated in large doses. The patient's body should be
frequently sponged with warm water in which a sufficient quantity of
saleratus or ordinary baking-soda has been dissolved to render it quite
strongly alkaline. If the bowels be constipated they should be moved by an
injection of starch-water. Beef tea and other concentrated, supporting diet
should be administrated. In those cases in which there is a tendency to
croup, the Golden Medical Discovery, together with iron and the bitter
tonics, should be given to build up the system and counteract such
tendency. The treatment which we have advised has been put to the severest
tests in the most severe forms of the disease, and has resulted most
successfully. If, however, in any case it does not give prompt relief, our
advice is to lose no time in summoning a physician who is known to be
skilled in the treatment of diseases of children.</p>

<p><b>Spasmodic Croup</b>. In this affection no false membrane is formed.
It seems to have a nervous origin. Most frequently the child is awakened in
the night by a sense of suffocation. He may cry out that he is choking. The
countenance is livid, the breathing is hurried <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_880" id="Page_880"></a>[pg 880]</span>and each respiration is
attended by a crowing sound. The child has fits of coughing or crying, and
makes vehement struggles to recover his breath. This complaint, unlike
croup, is unattended by fever, it being of a purely spasmodic character
with no inflammation.</p>

<p>Apply hot fomentations to the throat, and give frequent small doses of
tincture or fluid extract or syrup of lobelia, to produce slight nausea;
or, better still, an acetic syrup of blood-root, made by adding one
teaspoonful of the crushed or powdered root to one gill of vinegar and four
teaspoonfuls of white sugar. Heat this mixture to the boiling point,
strain, and administer from one-fourth to one teaspoonful every half-hour
or hour. Slight nausea should be kept up, but it is unnecessary to produce
vomiting. This is usually all the treatment that is required.</p>


<h3>WHOOPING-COUGH. (PERTUSSIS.)</h3>

<p>This is primarily a disease of the nervous system, involving the
respiratory organs through the medium of the pneumogastric nerve. It is
considered a disease of childhood, though we have met with it in <i>old
age</i>. It is eminently a contagious affection, and occurs generally but
once during life.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. It is at first manifested by a catarrhal cough,
gradually developed. After a while it becomes paroxysmal, generally worse
at night. The cough is severe, and long-continued; when a prolonged
inspiration occurs, it is accompanied by a peculiar shrill sound, the
characteristic <i>whoop</i>, which, when once heard, is never forgotten.
The cough is attended by a copious secretion of glairy mucus, which is
brought up at the latter part of the paroxysm. During, or at the end of the
paroxysm, vomiting frequently occurs, and sometimes nosebleed. The cough is
so severe at times, that the patient turns purple, gasps for breath, and
presents all the symptoms of suffocation. Bronchitis sometimes is a
troublesome complication. Immediately preceding a paroxysm of coughing a
sense of impending danger appears to seize the child, and it runs to its
mother, or grasps some support, as if for protection. Until the paroxysmal
character and peculiar <i>whoop</i> is developed, the disease is diagnosed
with difficulty.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. We have found the Golden Medical Discovery to modify
the disease and cut it short. The philosophy of its action can be readily
understood by its effect on the pneumogastric nerve, as explained under
consumption and bronchitis. Jaborandi, described under the head of
diaphoretics, often speedily arrests this disease. The employment of an
infusion of red clover blossoms, in small doses, is of undoubted value in
modifying the irritation of the air-passages, and may be used to good
advantage with, or in alternation with the Golden Medical Discovery.
Exposure to cold and wet should be avoided.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_881" id="Page_881"></a>[pg
881]</span><h3>NOSEBLEED.</h3>


<p>Hemorrhage from the nose is commonly the result either of a catarrhal or
an inflammatory condition of the nasal mucous membrane. Individuals are
susceptible to it who are oppressed by fever or constitutional diseases
that reduce the strength. There is also a condition of the nervous system
in which there is congestion of the nerve centres which favors
manifestations of this somewhat troublesome difficulty.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. In some instances an examination of the nose will reveal
the presence of a small point of congested vessels, usually about the size
of a split pea. Upon this portion of the mucous membrane small scabs form,
and at any time when they may be dislodged, by accident or otherwise, a
hemorrhage will ensue.</p>

<p>The constitutional conditions that produce the tendency to hemorrhage
are most important. In individuals of a debilitated condition, it results
from the lack of a proper amount of fibrin in the blood. Where the blood
becomes thin, or loses a large share of its red corpuscles, the individual
is pale, and hemorrhages are frequent from the mucous surfaces of any
portion of the body, the nasal mucous surface being especially liable to
such attacks.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. This is local and constitutional. Where there is
constitutional imperfection, it should be remedied. Usually in young women
there is some difficulty with the ovarian or uterine circulation, and the
attack of hemorrhage from the nose is reflex in its character, appearing
just before or at the time of the menstrual flow, accompanied with
troublesome headache. The correction of this form is by the use of the
"Favorite Prescription" and "Golden Medical Discovery," using of each a
teaspoonful three times a day, taking the "Prescription" before meals and
the "Discovery" after meals. If the bowels are constipated, the "Pellets"
should be employed, in order to overcome any congestion of the liver which
favors the manifestation of nosebleed. In children there is usually a
debilitated state of the system, which is best remedied by the use of a
half teaspoonful dose of the "Discovery," taken three times a day, after
meals, with sweetened water. This treatment should be continued for a month
or six weeks. By this means the blood-making organs rapidly improve in
their activity and functions, the blood becomes rich in corpuscles and
fibrin, thus strengthening the walls of the blood-vessels and tending to
prevent a hemorrhage following undue excitement or injury. With men the use
of laxatives is of great importance. One or more of the "Pellets," taken on
retiring at night, are most beneficial. Where the blood is not up to the
standard of purity, even though the individual be fleshy, the "Discovery"
should be used, a teaspoonful or two, three times a day, after meals, in
conjunction with plenty of outdoor exercise and the best of food. Where the
hemorrhages occur in those having too much blood, the diet must be
corrected by the use of vegetables and fruit, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_882" id="Page_882"></a>[pg 882]</span>diminishing the amount of
meat and pastries to a minimum. The amount of fibrin should also be
increased by the use of the "Golden Medical Discovery."</p>

<p><b>Local Treatment</b>. Of those applied directly to the membrane, Dr.
Sage's Catarrh Remedy, used according to the directions which wrap the
bottle, is excellent in bringing about a normal condition of the mucous
surfaces. Following this, a small amount of Subnitrate of Bismuth may be
snuffed into each nostril. Usually the amount required to cover a
three-cent silver piece is sufficient. The powder dries the surface and
favors the speedy formation of a coagulum, or clotted covering, which
effectually checks any further hemorrhage. The application of a firm
compress to the upper lip will also diminish the flow of blood through the
arteries that run to the anterior portion of the mucous surface. Good
effects often follow the use of a small piece of ice applied to the nape of
the neck. This, with a reclining posture, will cause contraction of the
blood-vessels. If the Subnitrate of Bismuth is not to be readily obtained,
the use of any other powder such as starch, finely divided and baked so as
to be free from a tendency to form starch paste when applied to a mucous
surface, is equally good. Well-browned flour is also serviceable. The use
of the contents of a puff-ball, which contains many millions of fine
spores, has been employed from time immemorial. The use of such drying
powders tends to favor the speedy formation of clots. Where the small
points of engorged vessels are to be readily reached, use a solution of the
Tincture of Chloride of Iron, one part in four of water, applying with a
small pledget of soft cotton wrapped about, or fastened to, the end of a
pencil or stick. In this way the solution may be applied in very small
amount to the spot where the hemorrhage appears, and will give immunity
from future attacks. Any of the styptics (see pages <a
href="advise04.html#Page_320">320</a>-<a href="advise04.html#Page_325">325</a>) can be called into
service. Those who have the advantage of the city drug store may use a
solution of basic ferric sulphate (Monsell's solution), or the spray of a
three or four per cent. solution of cocaine. The latter is one of the most
pleasant and effective remedies in these emergencies. Before its
administration the nasal cavity should be cleansed by snuffing up the
nostrils salt and warm water. When washed, immediately apply the spray. If
the constitutional condition which led to the hemorrhage continues, the
general remedies&mdash;of which the "Golden Medical Discovery" is the most
efficacious&mdash;should be administered. This agent increases the number of red
blood corpuscles, and enriches the blood in fibrin, so that the relief
obtained is absolutely permanent.</p>


<h3>INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH. (GASTRITIS.)</h3>

<p>Gastritis is generally defined as an inflammation of the mucous membrane
of the stomach. However, the cellular, muscular, and serous tissues are all
liable to be more or less affected. Gastritis may be <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_883" id="Page_883"></a>[pg 883]</span>either
<i>acute</i> or <i>chronic</i>. Either form is a distinct modification of
disease, manifesting peculiar symptoms and requiring special remedies.</p>

<p><i>Acute Gastritis</i> generally occurs as a result or complication of
other diseases. It is an occasional feature In scarlatina, serious cases of
bilious fever, and in cutaneous affections of every description. The mucous
membrane of the stomach is placed in intimate communication with all the
vital organs, by means of the nerves of the solar-plexus, hence the
sympathy between the stomach and skin, and the morbid condition of the
stomach occasioned by disease of other organs.</p>

<p><b>The Early Symptoms</b> of acute gastritis are a burning sensation in
the stomach, accompanied by nausea and frequent vomiting. The respiratory
movements are rapid and shallow, the pulse is hard and short, and as the
disease progresses, becomes small, frequent, and thready. The tongue
usually retains its natural appearance, but it is sometimes dry and tinged
with a vivid scarlet at the tip and edges. Intense thirst and hiccough are
occasional symptoms. The facial expression is haggard, and indicative of
the most intense suffering. The stomach will not retain the mildest
liquids. In the early stages of the disease, the ejections consist of chyme
and mucus, streaked with blood. As it progresses, the vomiting becomes a
sort of regurgitation, the contents of the stomach being ejected without
any apparent nausea or effort. The ejections then consist of a dark-colored
granular matter, resembling what is known in yellow fever as
<i>black-vomit</i>.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Formerly it was supposed that this was a very common
disorder, and the term <i>acute gastritis</i> was applied to every
development of symptomatic fever. But late clinical and pathological
investigations clearly indicate that acute gastritis is of rare occurrence.
It may be caused by the excessive and habitual use of alcoholic drinks,
especially if taken without food, by copious draughts of cold water, or by
intense emotions. But its <i>general</i> cause is the ingestion of
irritating and corrosive poisons.</p>

<p>Where the former causes are known not to exist, the presence of poison
should always be suspected. As the cause sometimes becomes a matter of
legal investigation, it is very important that the practitioner should be
able to determine the <i>real</i> origin. If caused by poison, the disease
is very suddenly developed, the patient complaining of a very intense
burning sensation in the throat and the lining membrane of the mouth, which
will generally show the action of the poison. A diarrhea is also more apt
to accompany the disease. If inorganic or vegetable poisons are known or
suspected irritants, the appropriate antidotes should be promptly
administered. For a list of the principal poisons and their antidotes, with
practical suggestions for treatment, the reader is referred to the article
in this volume, on Accidents and Emergencies.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The inflammation should be allayed, and a tea made of
peach-tree leaves is very serviceable. Small pieces of ice, swallowed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_884" id="Page_884"></a>[pg
884]</span>will generally allay the thirst and vomiting, and a mucilage of
slippery-elm is very soothing to the inflamed mucous membrane. This is an
important disease, and its management should be entrusted to a skillful
physician.</p>


<h3>CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH.</h3>


<p><i>Chronic Gastritis</i> is sometimes mistaken for dyspepsia or
gastralgia. It is very necessary to discriminate between these diseases, as
the appropriate remedies of the latter will often only aggravate and
augment the former.</p>

<p>A chronic inflammation of the stomach is a very common affection and has
many phases, but the term chronic gastritis is applied only to that species
of inflammation occasioned and accompanied by irritation. It is seldom a
result of the <i>acute</i> form.</p>

<p><b>The Symptoms</b> of chronic gastritis are various and sometimes
vague. Among those which are prominent we may mention an irregular
appetite. At times it is voracious and the patient will consume every
available article of diet, while at others he will experience nausea and
disgust at the sight of food. Even when very hungry, one mouthful of food
will sometimes produce satiety and cause vomiting. The appearance of the
tongue is variable, sometimes natural, at others thickly coated. The desire
for drink is capricious, varying from intense thirst to indifference.
Another prominent symptom is a sense of heaviness and heat in the
epigastric region, after partaking of food. Often a small quantity, as a
teaspoonful of milk, will produce a sensation of weight, as a heavy ball
lying at the pit of the stomach. This symptom is frequently accompanied by
a frontal headache, and a small and wiry pulse. Dull or shooting pains are
experienced in the stomach and between the shoulders, and the patient
becomes weary, melancholy, and emaciated.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. The general cause of chronic gastritis is excess in
eating or drinking, and the use of alcoholic liquors. We have known it to
be produced by drinking <i>hard</i> cider. Great mental excitement
predisposes the system to this affection. Occasionally it is a result of
febrile diseases, as scarlatina, typhoid fever, etc. In some families there
is a constitutional tendency to its development.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. All medicines which tend to irritate the stomach,
should be studiously avoided. The bowels should be kept regular, and the
skin clean by frequent bathing. Stimulants of all kinds must be avoided. As
a principle article of diet, we would recommend milk and farinaceous
articles. If these precautions be observed, nature will sometimes effect a
cure. Lime water and the subnitrate of bismuth, in twenty-grain doses three
or four times a day, are useful to allay irritation. Other suggestions
applicable to its domestic management, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_885" id="Page_885"></a>[pg 885]</span>maybe found under the
hygienic and medicinal treatment of dyspepsia, to which we refer the
reader.</p>


<h3>NEURALGIA OF THE STOMACH. (GASTRALGIA.)</h3>


<p>Gastralgia is a neuralgic affection of the stomach, unaccompanied by
inflammation. It is sometimes mistaken for chronic gastritis, although
there is a marked difference in the symptoms.</p>

<p><b>A Prominent Symptom of Gastralgia</b> is a <i>paroxysmal</i> pain
radiating from the epigastric region, to all parts of the thoracic cavity.
The pain is sometimes lessened by walking, lying on left side, or by gentle
pressure, and usually abates after eating, but is renewed in a few hours.
The patient occasionally experiences a sense of heaviness at the pit of the
stomach, nausea, and frequent salty eructations. The tongue is white, the
appetite variable, and there is no desire for liquids. The sleep is usually
refreshing, and when not suffering from acute pain, the patient is
apparently well.</p>

<p>The <i>distinguishing</i> symptom of this disease is a feeling of
intense despondency, and, sometimes, a morbid fear of death.</p>

<p>An effectual method of distinguishing between gastralgia and chronic
gastritis is by the administration of an alcoholic stimulant. If gastritis
be the affection the pain will be augmented; whereas, if it be gastralgia,
it will be relieved.</p>

<p><b>Cause</b>. The cause of gastralgia is a local or sympathetic
irritation of the nerves distributed to the stomach.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The pain of gastralgia is sometimes allayed by using
half a teaspoonful of subcarbonate of bismuth, and repeating the dose, if
the attack is not relieved. The following is a very effectual remedy: take
twenty grains of quinine, combined with one drachm of prussiate of iron,
and divide it into ten powders, and administer a powder every three hours
until the pain is completely arrested. Temporary relief may be given by
administering one-quarter of a grain of morphine, or ten to twenty drops of
chloroform in a teaspoonful of glycerine, slightly diluted, taken in one
dose. One of the most effective remedies for preventing a return of the
attacks is that invigorating tonic and alterative, the "Golden Medical
Discovery." The patient should be careful in diet, and not eat too much
food, which should not only be of a nutritious kind, but easy of digestion.
Cleanliness, suitable clothing, bodily warmth, exercise, and rest must not
be neglected. Sometimes it is lingering and requires long persistence in
hygienic and medicinal treatment. Everything tending to promote the tone of
the digestive organs, and improve the functions of the system generally may
be considered advantageous in this neuralgic affection.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_886" id="Page_886"></a>[pg
886]</span><h3>PERITONITIS.</h3>


<p>The <i>peritoneum</i>, or serous membrane which lines the abdominal
cavity and invests the intestines, is liable to become inflamed. When this
occurs, the affection is termed peritonitis, and may be divided into the
<i>acute</i> and <i>chronic</i> forms.</p>

<p><b>Acute Peritonitis</b>. This form may be circumscribed; that is,
confined to one spot, or it may extend over the entire surface of the
peritoneum, when it is known as <i>general</i>.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. There is headache, quick pulse, tongue coated white,
countenance pallid, features pinched, respiration difficult, nausea and
vomiting, severe pain in the abdomen, which is extremely sensitive to
pressure and becomes very much distended. There is also pain in the limbs,
the bowels are constipated, and, in exceptional cases, diarrhea is a
prominent symptom. The urine is deficient in quantity, and there is
sleeplessness, chilliness, and great general prostration. Vomiting and
coughing or sneezing increase the pain. An erect position occasions intense
suffering. The patient is compelled to assume a recumbent posture and is
inclined to lie on the back, for in that position the sufferer experiences
the least pressure of the vital organs against the peritoneum. There is
also an inclination to draw up the lower limbs and retain them in a flexed
position.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Prominent among these are injuries which have been
inflicted upon the intestines, compression of the colon, or rectum,
perforation of the stomach or bowels, either by violence or some
pre-existing disease, thus allowing the discharge of blood, urine, bile, or
fecal matter into the abdominal cavity; also abortion, over-exertion, and
exposure to wet or cold. As acute peritonitis is always a grave disease,
involving more or less danger to life, it is the wisest course to employ a
physician and trust the case to his management. The same remark is equally
applicable to the chronic form of the disease.</p>

<p><b>Chronic Peritonitis</b>. Like the acute, it may be either
<i>circumscribed</i> or <i>general</i>. This form is sometimes, though
rarely, a sequel of the acute. When it appears independently of the acute,
it is generally associated with some cutaneous affection pertaining to the
abdominal cavity, and the inflammation is induced by the tumor. If chronic
peritonitis be connected with the <i>tubercular</i> diathesis, tubercles
may be discovered upon the surface of the stomach and alimentary canal, and
may also be found in the lungs and brain.</p>

<p>When the affection is not tubercular there will appear in the abdominal
cavity an effusion of serous fluid of greater or less quantity, mingled
with blood and pus. When such an effusion takes place, the abdomen
gradually increases in size, or becomes smaller than is natural. There is
pain, attended by soreness upon pressure, and the patient becomes
emaciated.</p>

<p>Inflammation of the peritoneum is frequently an accompaniment of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_887" id="Page_887"></a>[pg
887]</span><i>puerperal fever</i>, which is a disease peculiar to
childbirth, and which may arise from cold, or be communicated from one
parturient patient to another by midwives.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In the remedial management of acute peritonitis, it is
obviously necessary to use some agent which will at once influence and
change the congested state and inflammatory condition. One of the best
agents employed to make a decided impression upon the vascular system,
subdue inflammation, and modify its action, is the fluid extract of
veratrum viride, administered in full doses, and repeated until the system
shows its effects in a decided manner. Warm fomentations applied to the
abdomen are sometimes very serviceable, and are objectionable only because
of their liability to dampen the bed-clothes. When the abdomen will bear a
thick, warm poultice, apply it, and then cover the entire surface with
oiled silk. The tincture of opium, in doses sufficient to relieve pain and
quiet the peristaltic action of the intestines, is generally necessary.</p>


<h3>EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.</h3>


<p>This is an epidemic disease, supposed to be due to an impalpable
specific poison, but as to the exact nature of this poisonous matter
nothing definite is known.</p>

<p>This plague first made its appearance on our continent in 1834. Owing to
its great fatality, it is a disease much to be dreaded.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. These are well defined. It is characterized in its
earlier stages by pain in the stomach and bowels, especially in the
umbilical region, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; later, the purging is
excessive, and the matter dejected resembles rice-water, and contains
white, solid, curd-like matter. The patient loses strength, and sinks
rapidly. The secretory organs fail to perform their functions normally, the
skin is sometimes moist, but oftener cold and dry; but little if any bile
is found in the excretions, and the urine voided is very scanty. There is
general nervous derangement, as indicated by the spasmodic contraction or
cramping of the muscles. This first attacks the extremities, but soon
affects the entire body, and gives rise to excruciating pains. The head is
affected by singing, roaring, disagreeable noises in the ears, the pulse is
feeble, but quick, the nails are of a bluish color, the tongue is coated
white, the eyes are sunken, and the patient has a corpse-like appearance;
the temperature of the body rapidly falls, the surface becomes deathly
cold, and, unless the disease is promptly arrested in its course, speedy
dissolution follows. The disease is rarely prolonged beyond twenty-four
hours, and sometimes terminates within three or four hours after its first
attack.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The kind of medicine required depends upon the
severity of the attack and stage of the disease. In all cholera epidemics,
there are premonitory symptoms, such, as an uneasy sensation <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_888" id="Page_888"></a>[pg 888]</span>at the
pit of the stomach, and a rumbling of the bowels. This is apt to be
followed by a painless diarrhea, which occasions no alarm, and the patient
pays but little attention to it. Herein is the great and dangerous mistake.
The patient is already in the stage of <i>invasion</i>, which must be
promptly arrested, or he will suddenly be precipitated into the stage of
<i>collapse</i>. The patient should lie down, and have placed about him
bottles filled with hot water, thereby exciting warmth upon the surface of
the body. At the same time, administer two teaspoonfuls of the Extract of
Smart-weed. If the symptoms are urgent, repeat the dose every fifteen
minutes. Brandy, thickened with sugar, may also be given. In either the
stage of <i>invasion</i> or <i>collapse</i>, the leading indication is to
establish <i>reaction</i> by promoting perspiration. Bathe the feet in
water as hot as can be borne, give the Extract of Swart-weed freely, and
thus endeavor to excite profuse diaphoresis. No time should be lost, for
delays are dangerous. When the reaction is established, the patient should
remain quiet, and not attempt to exert himself.</p>

<p>After reaction has taken place, the sweating should be maintained for
twelve hours, and the patient should drink slippery-elm tea and
toast-water, and partake sparingly of soft toasted bread and chicken broth.
The food should be fluid and nutritious, but taken in small quantities. Do
not disturb the bowels with laxatives until the third day after the patient
begins to improve, and then they may be moved by an injection of warm
water. Great care should be taken that the patient does not indulge too
soon or too freely in the use of food. When a skillful physician can be
had, no time should be lost in securing his services, but since in
epidemics of this nature, medical men are generally overworked, and not
always easily and promptly to be had, we have been quite explicit in giving
full directions for treatment.</p>

<p><b>Cholera Morbus</b>, also known as <i>sporadic cholera</i> and
<i>simple cholera</i>, usually occurs during the summer months. The attack
may be sudden, although it is usually preceded by a sensation of uneasiness
and colicky pains in the stomach.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. Nausea, vomiting and purging are the most prominent
symptoms. The discharge from the bowels is at first of a thin, yellow
appearance, but finally it becomes almost colorless. Sometimes, after the
contents proper of the bowels have been evacuated, the dejections have a
bilious appearance. Severe cramps and pain accompany the vomiting. The
vomiting and purging usually occur in paroxysms, but finally become less
frequent, a reaction takes place, the extremities grow warm, and the
patient gradually recovers. It may be accompanied by intense thirst and a
quick pulse, yet the surface may be cool.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Cholera morbus is most prevalent in warm climates, and
especially in malarial districts. It is generally the result of eating
indigestible articles of food, such as unripe fruit or uncooked vegetables.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_889" id="Page_889"></a>[pg
889]</span>Stimulating drinks, or those articles which furnish the elements
for fermentation, also favor the production of this disease.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. If the attack be superinduced by eating unripe or
stale fruit, it may be proper to give an emetic or a cathartic, but
ordinarily first give a full dose of the Extract of Smart-weed, and, if the
vomited matter is very sour, give the patient a weak, alkaline drink, which
may be made by dropping a few live, hard-wood coals into a tumbler of
water. This will not only assist in neutralizing the acidity of the
stomach, but will help to allay the thirst and accompanying fever. If the
patient throw up the first dose of the Extract of Smart-weed, a second
should be given. Do not allow the patient to drink cold water, and give
only tablespoonful doses of the alkaline solution every thirty minutes. If
the thirst is great, occasionally give a tablespoonful of a tea made from
scorched Indian meal, which not only allays the desire to drink, but also
the irritation of the stomach. If to be obtained, give a tea of the leaves
or bark of the peach tree. The patient should be well covered in bed and
kept warm. Laudanum by the stomach, or by enema, may he necessary in severe
cases to relieve the pain and check the purging. Hot fomentations applied
to the bowels are very valuable. A mustard plaster applied over the abdomen
will assist materially in relieving the nausea and vomiting. It should not
be left on sufficiently long to blister. When the affection is promptly
treated as we have suggested, the patient generally quickly recovers. If,
however, it does not yield to these measures, the family physician should
be called in.</p>


<h3>ACCIDENTS AND EMERGENCIES.</h3>


<p>Accidents and emergencies which require immediate attention frequently
occur. Professional aid cannot always be quickly obtained and hence fatal
results often follow. It is, therefore, important that all persons should
not only know how to proceed under such circumstances, but that they should
be able to exercise that deliberation and self-control so necessary in
emergencies of all kinds. Most persons are more or less affected by the
sight of blood or severe wounds, and it requires an effort to maintain
self-possession. One should act resolutely; otherwise he will find himself
overcome and unable to render any assistance.</p>


<h3>WOUNDS.</h3>


<p>Wounds may be classified as <i>incised, punctured, contused,
lacerated</i>, or <i>poisoned</i>.</p>

<p><i>Incised</i> wounds are those which are made with a sharp, cutting
instrument, and are characterized by their extent of surface.</p>

<p><i>Punctured</i> wounds are made with a pointed instrument, and
distinguished for their depth rather than breadth.</p>

<p><i>Contused</i> wounds are those produced by bruises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_890" id="Page_890"></a>[pg
890]</span><i>Lacerated</i> wounds are those in which the flesh is torn and
mangled.</p>

<p><i>Poisoned</i> wounds are made with a poisoned instrument, or by some
poisonous reptile or insect or rabid animal.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise679"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 1. The field Tourniquet as applied. " src="images/advise679.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 1. The field Tourniquet as applied. </p>

<p>In all cases of wounds, the immediate danger is in the <i>shock</i>
produced upon the nervous system, and in the liability to
<i>hemorrhage</i>.</p>

<p><b>Shock</b>. If severe, the shock is attended with symptoms of extreme
prostration, such as a feeble pulse, shivering, partial unconsciousness,
fainting, hiccough, vomiting, and involuntary discharges of the urine and
feces.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise680"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 2. Mode of employing flexion for the arrest of hemorrhage from a wound
located below the elbow. " src="images/advise680.png" /></a><br />Fig. 2.
Mode of employing flexion for the arrest of hemorrhage from a wound located
below the elbow. </p>

<p><b>Treatment of Shock</b>. The clothing should be loosened immediately
after the accident, so that the blood may have free circulation, and the
patient should be kept in a recumbent position. He should have plenty of
fresh air. Camphor or ammonia may be inhaled. If he can swallow, stimulants
may be given, as whiskey or brandy, but with care that they do not run into
the trachea, or windpipe. If he be unable to swallow, they may be
administered as injections, but should gradually be discontinued as
reaction takes place. A warm pillow placed at the back and the use of
electricity may be beneficial.</p>

<p><b>Hemorrhage</b>, or bleeding, may generally be controlled by a
<i>compress, tourniquet, flexion of the joint</i>, or <i>styptics.</i> A
<i>compress</i> consists of several folds of cloth laid upon a wound, the
edges of which have been brought together, and made secure by a moderately
tight bandage.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise681"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 3. Mode of employing flexion for the arrest of hemorrhage from a wound
below the knee." src="images/advise681.png" /></a><br />Fig. 3. Mode of
employing flexion for the arrest of hemorrhage from a wound below the
knee.</p>

<p><i>A tourniquet</i> may be extemporized by rolling a handkerchief into a
cord and tying it around the limb, over a compress, between the wound and
the heart. A stick should then be thrust between the handkerchief and skin
and twisted around several times, until the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_891" id="Page_891"></a>[pg 891]</span><span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_892" id="Page_892"></a>[pg 892]</span>pressure is sufficiently
great to arrest the circulation of the blood in the wounded part. A
representation of this operation may be seen in Fig. 1.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise682"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Mode of employing flexion for the arrest of hemorrhage from a wound located
between the thigh and knee." src="images/advise682.png" /></a><br /> Mode
of employing flexion for the arrest of hemorrhage from a wound located
between the thigh and knee.</p>

<p><i>Flexion of the joint</i>, as represented in Figs. 2, 3, and 4, is
adapted to many cases of hemorrhage. As water cannot flow through a rubber
tube bent at a sharp angle, so the acute flexion of a limb prevents the
free flow of blood through the arterial tubes.</p>

<p>In some cases, <i>styptics</i> may be directly applied to the wounded
tissues. Cold acts as a powerful styptic, and may generally be made
available for arresting hemorrhage.</p>

<p><b>Poisoned Wounds.</b> The treatment of these should chiefly consist in
the prevention of the spread of the poison. This may be done by tightly
applying bandages above the wound and scarifying or sucking the parts.
Nitrate of silver may then be used and the ligatures removed. Alcohol, in
any form, is an antidote to snake poison. For the stings of insects, apply
aqua ammonia, fresh earth, raw onion, plantain, or spirits of
turpentine.</p>


<h3>FRACTURES AND DISLOCATIONS.</h3>


<p>The treatment of injuries received from the fracture of bones and the
dislocation of joints should never be attempted by the inexperienced, nor
should the management be left to incompetent physicians but <i>skillful</i>
surgical aid should at once be summoned.</p>


<h3>SPRAINS.</h3>


<p>A sprain consists of a sudden and forcible stretching of the ligaments
and tendons connected with a joint, without there being any dislocation. It
is attended with severe pain and is followed by rapid swelling.</p>

<p>The treatment should consist of measures to prevent inflammation,
promote absorption, and restore a healthy action. The affected part should
be kept at rest in an elevated position, and hot or cold water applied
frequently. If there is much inflammation, fomentations of hops may be
used. The Compound Extract of Smart-weed is an excellent application.</p>

<p>When the acute symptoms have disappeared, absorption should be favored
by systematic rubbing and the application of stimulating liniments, or by
the use of a well-adjusted bandage. Passive motion may be resorted to
gradually and the subject may use the joint moderately. Should any
stiffness remain, warm salt water douches should be employed and the
Extract of Smart-weed applied once a day.</p>


<h3>BRUISES.</h3>


<p>Bruises or contusions are caused by falls, wrenches, or blows from blunt
instruments, without breaking the skin. The soft tissues are lacerated and
blood is poured out into them, constituting <i>ecchymosis</i>. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_893" id="Page_893"></a>[pg 893]</span>The
discoloration passes through various shades from a bluish-black to a
violet, a green, and finally, a yellow.</p>

<p>If the bruise is severe, the affected part should be kept at rest and
frequently bathed with the Compound Extract of Smart-weed or the tincture
of arnica. If inflammatory symptoms supervene, fomentations and poultices
should be applied.</p>


<h3>FOREIGN BODIES IN THE NOSE.</h3>


<p>Foreign bodies, such as beads, peas, coffee-grains, and small
gravel-stones are occasionally introduced into the nostrils of children,
becoming fastened there, and causing great anxiety and alarm. If allowed to
remain, they generally cause inflammation and suffering.</p>

<p>Such bodies may generally be washed out by gently injecting a stream of
tepid salt water with a syringe or Dr. Pierce's Nasal Douche. In no case
should force be used. If these means fail, a competent surgeon should be
consulted.</p>


<h3>FOREIGN BODIES IN THE THROAT AND AIR-PASSAGES.</h3>


<p>Foreign bodies are generally arrested so high up that they may be seen
by simply depressing the tongue, and removed with the finger or a pair of
forceps. The head should be thrown back in such a position as to cause the
chin to project as little as possible beyond the prominence known as Adam's
apple, in order that the finger or forceps may be readily introduced and
the body released and ejected. When the foreign bodies are so small as to
pass out of sight in the larynx, windpipe, or esophagus, it is generally
difficult to extract them, and the services of a surgeon are required.
Fortunately, however, there is not much immediate danger from suffocation
in such cases.</p>


<h3>DROWNING.</h3>


<p>Recovery from drowning sometimes occurs when life is apparently extinct.
The treatment, however, should be immediate and energetic, and should be
given in the open air, unless the weather be too cold.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The patient should be gently placed upon the face with
his wrists under his forehead. The tongue will then fall forward and the
water run out of his mouth and throat, while the windpipe, or air-passage,
will be free. To restore respiration, he should be instantly turned upon
his right side, his nostrils excited with snuff or ammonia, and cold water
dashed upon his face and chest. If this operation prove unsuccessful,
replace the patient upon his face, care being taken to raise and support
his chest, turn the body gently on the side and quickly again upon the
face. Alternate these movements about every four seconds, and occasionally
change sides. When the body is turned <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_894" id="Page_894"></a>[pg 894]</span>on the face, gentle but
efficient pressure should be made along the back, between the shoulder
blades, to assist in forcing the air out of the lungs, but this pressure
ought to be removed before the patient is turned back on his side.
Persistently repeat this operation, and success will often be the reward.
As soon as respiration is established, warmth may be promoted by the
application of warm flannels to the body and bottles of hot water to the
stomach, armpits, thighs, and feet. During the entire process of
restoration, the body should be thoroughly rubbed <i>upwards</i>. Turning
the body upon the back or handling it roughly should be avoided. The person
should not be held up by his feet, or be rubbed with salt or spirits.
Rolling the body on a cask is improper, and injections of the smoke
infusion of tobacco are injurious. Avoid the constant application of the
warm bath, and do not allow a crowd to surround the body.</p>


<h3>FAINTING.</h3>


<p>When a person faints, <i>he should be allowed to remain or be placed in
a recumbent posture</i>, and his clothing immediately loosened. The
extremities should be rubbed, the patient permitted to have plenty of fresh
air, and, if at hand, ammonia or camphor should be applied to the
nostrils.</p>


<h3>BURNS AND SCALDS.</h3>


<p>The danger arising from burns and scalds depends not only upon the
extent of surface involved, but also upon the depth of the injury. Burns
are most dangerous when occurring upon the head, chest, or abdomen.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Soothing applications, and those which will exclude
the air, should be made. Grated potato, poultices of slippery-elm, sweet
oil, cotton saturated in a mixture composed of two or three grains of
carbolic acid and two ounces of glycerine, and linseed oil and white lead,
are all beneficial for the treatment of burns. If internal treatment be
necessary, it should be given under the direction of a competent
physician.</p>


<h3>SUN-STROKE.</h3>


<p>In cases of sun-stroke, the patient should be at once removed into the
shade. If the face is <i>flushed</i>, apply cold water to the head and
neck, and mustard to the feet. The body should be bathed in tepid water and
the head slightly elevated. If the countenance is pale, the symptoms denote
exhaustion, and the patient should be kept in a recumbent position, the
extremities rubbed, camphor and ammonia inhaled, mustard applied to the
spine, and stimulants, such as brandy or whiskey, should be
administered.</p>

<h2>POSTERIOR SPINAL CURVATURE.</h2>

<h3>(HUMPBACK.)</h3>


<p>Posterior curvature of the spine, sometimes known as Pott's Disease,
occurs most frequently in children, and is generally developed before the
seventh year. Children of a scrofulous diathesis are especially liable to
this affection. It is generally due to disease of the inter-vertebral
cartilages and bodies of the vertebr&aelig;. It comes on in a slow,
insidious manner, hence, it often makes serious inroads upon the spine and
system before its character is even suspected.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise683"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 1.  The above portion of the spinal column shows the manner of the
breaking down of the vertebr&aelig; from caries, and the absorption of
their bony structure." src="images/advise683.png" /></a><br />Fig. 1.  The
above portion of the spinal column shows the manner of the breaking down of
the vertebr&aelig; from caries, and the absorption of their bony
structure.</p>

<p>Generally the first point of invasion is the cartilaginous substances
between the bodies of the vertebr&aelig;, beginning with inflammation, and
finally resulting in ulceration and a breaking-down of the cartilages. It
next invades the vertebr&aelig; themselves, and producing caries, or death
and decay of the bony substance, which softens and wastes away, as shown in
Fig. 1. The vertebr&aelig; become softened and broken down, and weight of
the body pressing them together produces the deformity known as "humpback."
(See Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.)</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. Among the various symptoms present in the earlier
stages of the disease, and during its progress, we deem it necessary to
mention only a few of the more prominent ones. While the patient is yet
able to go around, the disease manifests itself by occasional pain in the
bowels, stomach, and chest. Often there is a hacking cough, nervousness,
lassitude, and a generally enfeebled condition of the whole system. The
patient is easily fatigued; there is apparent loss of vitality, impaired
appetite, a feeling of tightness across the stomach and chest, gradually
declining health, and loss of flesh and strength, torpidity of the liver,
deficient secretions, constipation, and morbid excretions from the kidneys.
The victim, in passing chairs, tables, and other objects, instinctively
places his hands upon them, and, as the disease progresses, when standing,
leans upon some support whenever possible. In walking, he moves very
carefully and cautiously, with elbows thrown back and chest forward, to
assist the body in keeping its equilibrium. The body being kept in an <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_899" id="Page_899"></a>[pg 899]</span>upright
position, the patient bends the knees rather than the back in stooping, as
illustrated in Fig. 5, and the body is frequently supported by the hands
being placed upon the thighs or knees. Sudden movements or shocks cause
more or less pain.</p>

<p>The development of the disease then becomes rapid; suffering increases,
and pain about the joints and lower extremities and muscles of the
posterior part of the pelvis is experienced; numbness and coldness of the
extremities are felt; locomotion becomes more difficult, and a slight
projection is observed upon the back. Even in this somewhat advanced stage
of the disease, when the symptoms are so apparent, many cases are
shamefully neglected because an ignorant adviser says it is nothing serious
and that the patient will outgrow it. The pain and tenderness not always
being in the back, the inexperienced are very often misled as to the true
character of the trouble. This distortion or deformity of the back now
becomes painfully prominent; the diseased vertebr&aelig; quickly soften and
waste away; the pressure upon the spinal cord increases, and paralysis of
the limbs supervenes; the power of locomotion is lost, and, at last, the
danger is realized and the struggle for life begins.</p>

<p>Thus, through ignorance, neglect, and improper treatment, the poor,
helpless victim is doomed to a life of hideous deformity and suffering. We
would, therefore, urge upon parents whose children are afflicted with this
terrible disease, the great importance of placing them under the care of
surgeons who have for many years made the treatment of such cases a
specialty, and who have every facility and all necessary surgical
appliances for insuring success in every case undertaken.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The great essentials for the successful treatment of
disease and deformities of the spine are first, a thorough knowledge of the
structure and parts involved by the disease; secondly, the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_900" id="Page_900"></a>[pg
900]</span>adjustment of mechanical appliances perfectly adapted to the
requirements and necessities of each individual case, and the proper use of
our system of "vitalization," applied to the spinal muscles to strengthen
the weaker and relieve the undue contraction of the stronger. For many
years our specialists have experimented, and have given the various
appliances in common use in these cases most thorough and practical tests,
and have found them very defective, being generally constructed upon wrong
principles. The physician who sends to a mechanic for an appliance, such as
are now made in the shops of most instrument makers, and uses the same, is
doing himself an injustice, and barbarously torturing his patient by
forcing him to wear an apparatus which is heavy, clumsy, and inevitably
injurious, instead of being beneficial in its results. In the treatment of
diseases and deformities of the spine, there should be no compromising; the
appliance that fails to give complete support should not be worn. In our
treatment of these maladies we employ only appliances which are constructed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_901" id="Page_901"></a>[pg
901]</span>under the personal supervision of our specialists, upon
principles dictated by common sense and the actual necessities of the case.
We do not confine the body in an iron jacket. Our apparatus is light, yet
durable, and is worn by the most delicate children without pain or
inconvenience. It gives proper support to all parts, and is so nicely
adjusted as to produce pressure only upon those points which should receive
support, leaving the muscles of the spine freedom of action, thereby
assisting in their development. In many hundreds of cases treated by our
specialists, the disease has been entirely cured and the deformity removed.
After seeing the patients and adjusting the appliances, they can generally
be treated at their homes.</p>


<h2>LATERAL CURVATURE OF THE SPINE.</h2>

<h3>(CROOKED BACK.)</h3>

src="images/advise689.png" /></a><br />Fig. 7. A mild case of lateral
curvature of the spine.</p>

<p>This deformity appears more frequently in an&aelig;mic persons, in whom
the flexibility and elasticity of the muscles are weakened, than in those
of a plethoric habit. It is generally contracted during youth, between the
ages of twelve and eighteen. Persons of sedentary and indolent habits are
especially liable to this deformity, hence, girls are most frequently its
victims. It is never seen among the natives of tropical countries who
habitually live in the open air, and seldom among the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_902" id="Page_902"></a>[pg
902]</span>barbarous races of northern latitudes. A distinguishing feature
of the American Indian is his erect carriage. The <i>primary</i> curvature
is generally toward the right side, as represented in Figs. 6 and 7. Figs.
8 and 9 show the disease in a more advanced stage. The ribs are thus forced
into an unnatural position, and the vital organs contained in the cavity of
the chest are compressed or displaced, thus distorting the form of the
whole upper portion of the body.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise690"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 8. Lateral curvature in an advanced stage. "
src="images/advise690.png" /></a><br />Fig. 8. Lateral curvature in an
advanced stage. </p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise691"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 9. Lateral curvature in an advanced stage. "
src="images/advise691.png" /></a><br />Fig. 9. Lateral curvature in an
advanced stage. </p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The first indication of lateral curvature of the spine
is a marked projection of the right scapula, or shoulder-blade. It is
sometimes first observed by the dressmaker, or, accidentally, while
bathing. The right shoulder is slightly elevated, while the left hip is
depressed and projects upward. If not corrected while in its earlier
stages, it progresses very rapidly, and a second curvature is developed.
The symptoms vary in different cases, and in the early stages are somewhat
obscure and undefined, but generally the patient feels a sense of
uneasiness, languor, stupor, and nervousness, loss of energy and ambition,
general debility, poor appetite, gradually declining health, loss of
strength and flesh, and, as the disease progresses, a slight elevation of
one of the shoulder-blades is noticed, as well as the deviation of the
spine to one side. The curve, or distortion, of the spine increases more
rapidly as the body becomes heavier, the spine often assuming the shape of
the letter S, and, from compression by torsion of the vertebr&aelig; and
distortion of the ribs, the vital organs are <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_903" id="Page_903"></a>[pg 903]</span>encroached upon, causing
serious functional derangement of the heart, lungs, liver, and stomach,
producing, as its inevitable consequence a list of maladies fearful to
contemplate.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. In rare instances, the lateral curvature of the spine is
due to defects of certain bones of the pelvis or limbs. Cases are recorded
in which this deformity was caused by diseases of the abdominal organs,
but, as we have intimated, it is generally due to a lack of tonicity of the
muscles, or, as a late writer has expressed it, "Want of correspondence in
the antagonism of those muscles which control the motions of the spinal
column." Habitual sitting or standing in a leaning posture, or standing
upon one foot, thus constantly using one set of the muscles of the back,
while the other becomes enfeebled by the lack of exercise, is a common
cause of this deformity. The habit which so many school-girls contract of
drawing up one foot under the body while sitting, often produces a lateral
curvature of the spine.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. No disease or deformity of the spine is so easily
cured and perfectly corrected, if the proper plan of treatment is pursued.
To correct this deformity, many ingenious forms of apparatus have been
devised and invented by our specialists, which should be carefully adjusted
to each individual case. In addition to this, our method of treatment by
"vitalization," and by mechanical movements and manipulations, is almost
indispensable in these cases. It never fails to give relief, and, if
properly pursued, invariably results in a permanent cure.</p>


<h3>DEFORMED FEET, HANDS AND LIMBS.</h3>


<p>There are thousands whose feet, hands, and limbs are almost entirely
useless, besides having an unsightly appearance. Their condition has been
helpless so long, their treatment so varied, and their hopes of relief or
cure have been so often disappointed, that few can believe the truth of our
statement, when we positively assert that we can correct and cure nearly
all cases of talipes, club, or crooked feet and deformed hands, and make
them as perfect in appearance, and as useful in action, as feet and hands
which have never been deformed. While this may seem miraculous, or even
impossible, to those who are unacquainted with the wonderful improvements
and rapid progress made in this department of surgical science, it is
attested and verified by living witnesses whose feet and hands were once
deformed and useless, but which have been made perfect by our new and
improved method of treatment. We do not make these statements in a spirit
of vain boastfulness, but having devoted many years to improving and
perfecting surgical appliances and apparatus, and having had practical
experience in the successful treatment of thousands of cases, we do say
that our manner of treatment is original and employed only by us. We
entirely ignore the ineffectual methods usually employed in such cases. Our
treatment causes no pain, and little inconvenience, yet the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_904" id="Page_904"></a>[pg
904]</span>curative results are speedy and certain, and a hundredfold more
satisfactory than those obtained by any other course.</p>

<p>We have most thoroughly tested all the best forms of treatment
heretofore devised and employed in this class of diseases, and have adopted
the best features of all the various methods heretofore pursued. We have
combined these with our own improvements and, as the result, we have
perfected a thorough and efficient system of treatment, based upon
scientific principles.</p>
