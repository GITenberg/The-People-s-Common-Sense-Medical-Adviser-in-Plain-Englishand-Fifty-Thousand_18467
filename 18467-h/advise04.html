<h1>RATIONAL MEDICINE.</h1>




<h2><a name='IIICHAPTER_I'></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h1>THE PROGRESS OF MEDICINE.</h1>


<p>During the last half century a great change has taken place  in the
treatment of disease. Medicine has advanced with rapid strides, from the
narrow limits of mere empiricism, to the broader realm of rationalism,
until to day it comprehends all the elements of an art and a science.
Scientific researches and investigations have added many valuable truths to
the general fund of medical learning, but much more has been effected by
observation and empirical discovery. It is of little or no interest to the
invalid to know whether the prescribed remedy is organic or inorganic,
simple, compound, or complex. In his anxiety and distress of body, he seeks
solely for relief, without regard to the character of the remedial agents
employed. But this indifference on the part of the patient does not obviate
the necessity for a thorough, scientific education on the part of the
practitioner. Notwithstanding all the laws enacted to raise the standard of
medicine, and thus protect the public from quackery, there yet exists a
disposition among many to cling to all that savors of the miraculous, or
supernatural. To insure the future advancement of the healing art,
physicians must instruct mankind in Physiology, Hygiene, and Medicine. When
the people understand the nature of diseases, their causes, methods of
prevention and cure, they will not be easily deceived, and practitioners
will be obliged to qualify themselves better for their labors. The practice
of medicine is every year becoming <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293"
id="Page_293"></a>[pg 293]</span>more successful. New and improved methods
of treating disease are being discovered and developed, and the
conscientious physician will avail himself of <i>all</i> the means, by a
knowledge of which he may benefit his fellow-men. The medical profession is
divided into three principal schools, or sects.</p>


<h4>THE ALLOPATHIC, REGULAR, OR OLD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE.</h4>


<p>This is the oldest existing branch of the profession. To it is due the
credit of collecting and arranging the facts and discoveries which form the
foundation of the healing art. It has done, and is doing, much to place the
science of medicine on a firm basis. To the text-books of this school,
every student who would qualify himself for medical practice must resort,
to gain that knowledge upon which depends his future success. The early
practice of this branch of the profession was necessarily crude and
empirical. Conservative in its character, it has ever been slow to
recognize new theories and methods of practice, and has failed to adopt
them until they have been incontrovertibly established. This conservatism
was manifested in the opposition to Harvey when he propounded the theory of
the circulation of the blood, and to Jenner when he discovered and
demonstrated the beneficial effects of vaccination. Thus has it ever
defended its established opinions against innovation; yet out of this very
conservatism has grown much real good, for, although it has wasted no time
or energy in the investigation of theories, yet it has accepted them when
established. In this manner it has added to its fund of knowledge only
those truths which are of real and intrinsic value.</p>

<p>The history of medicine may be divided into three eras. In the first,
the practice of medicine was merely empiricism. Ignorant priests or
astrologers administered drugs, concerning the properties of which they had
no knowledge, to appease the wrath of mythological deities. In the second
or heroic era, the lancet, mercury, antimony, opium, and the blister were
employed indiscriminately as the <i>sine qua non</i> of medical practice.
The present, with all its scientific knowledge of the human structure and
functions, and its vast resources for remedying disease may be aptly termed
the liberal era of medicine. The allopathic <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[pg 294]</span>differs from the other
schools, mainly in the application of remedies. In its ranks are found men,
indefatigable in their labors, delving deep into the mysteries of nature,
and who, for their scientific attainments and humane principles are justly
considered ornaments to society and to their profession.</p>


<h4>HOMOEOPATHY.</h4>


<p>Although this school is of comparatively recent origin, yet it has
gained a powerful hold upon the public favor, and numbers among its patrons
very many intelligent citizens. This fact alone would seem to indicate that
it possesses some merit. The homeopathic differs from the allopathic school
principally in its <i>"law of cure,"</i> which, according to Hahnemann, its
founder, was the doctrine of <i>"similia similibus curantur"</i> or "like
cures like." Its method of treatment is founded upon the assumption that if
a drug be given to a healthy person, symptoms will occur which, if
transpiring in disease, would be mitigated by the same drug. While it may
be exceedingly difficult for a member of another school to accept this
doctrine and comprehend the method founded upon it, yet no one can deny
that it contains some elements of truth.</p>

<p>Imbued with the spirit of progress, many of its most intelligent and
successful practitioners have resorted to the use of appreciable quantities
of medicine. This school associates hydropathy with its practice, and
usually inculcates rigid dietetic and hygienic regulations. Many
homoeopathic remedies are thoroughly triturated with sugar of milk, which
renders them more palatable and efficacious. Whether we attribute their
cures to the infinitesimal doses which many homoeopathists employ, to their
"law of cure," to good nursing, or to the power of nature, it is
nevertheless true that their practice is measurably successful. No doubt
the homoeopathic practice has modified that of the other schools, by
proving that diseases may be alleviated by smaller quantities of medicine
than were formerly employed.</p>


<h4>THE ECLECTIC SCHOOL.</h4>


<p>This school, founded by Wooster Beach, instituted the most strenuous
opposition to the employment of mercury, antimony, the blister, and the
lancet. The members of this new school <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[pg 295]</span>proclaimed that the action
of heroic and noxious medicines was opposed to the operation of the vital
forces, and proposed to substitute in their place safer and more
efficacious agents, derived exclusively from the vegetable kingdom. The
eclectics have investigated the properties of indigenous plants and have
discovered many valuable remedies, which a kind and bounteous nature has so
generously supplied for the healing of her children. Marked success
attended the employment of these agents. In 1852, a committee on
"Indigenous Medical Botany," appointed by the "American Medical
Association," acknowledged that the practitioners of the regular school had
been extremely ignorant of the medical virtues of plants, even of those of
their own neighborhoods. The employment of podophyllin and leptandrin as
substitutes for mercurials has been so successful that they are now used by
practitioners of all schools. Although claiming to have been founded upon
liberal principles, it may be questioned whether its adherents have not
been quite as exclusive and dogmatic as those whom they have opposed. It
cannot be denied, however, that the eclectics have added many important
remedies to the Materia Medica. Their writings are important and useful
contributions to the physician's library.</p>


<h4>THE LIBERAL AND INDEPENDENT PHYSICIAN.</h4>


<p>After this brief review of the various medical sects, the reader may be
curious to learn to what sect the physicians of the Invalids' Hotel and
Surgical Institute belong. Among them are to be found graduates from the
colleges of all the different schools. They are not restricted by the
tenets of any one sect, but claim the right and privilege, nay, consider it
a duty, to select from all, such remedies as careful investigation,
scientific research, and an extensive experience, have proved valuable.
They resort to any and every agent which has been proved efficacious,
whether it be vegetable or mineral.</p>

<p>And here arises a distinction between <i>sanative</i> remedial agents
and those which are <i>noxious</i>. Many practitioners deplore the use of
poisons, and advocate innocuous medicines which produce only curative
results. We agree with them in one proposition, namely, that improper
medicines not only poison, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296"
id="Page_296"></a>[pg 296]</span>but frequently utterly destroy the health
and body of the patient. Every physician should keep steadily in view the
final effects, as well as present relief, and never employ any agent
without regard to its ulterior consequences. However, an agent which is
noxious in <i>health</i>, may prove a valuable remedy in <i>disease</i>.
When morbid changes have taken place in the blood and tissues, when a
general diseased condition of the bodily organs has occurred, then an
agent, which is poisonous in health, may prove curative. For instance it is
admitted that alcohol is a poison; that it prevents healthful assimilation,
solidifies pepsin, begets a morbid appetite; that it produces intoxication,
and that its habitual use destroys the body. It is, therefore, neither a
hygienic nor a sanative agent, but strictly a noxious one; yet, its very
distinct antiseptic properties render it valuable for remedial purposes,
since these qualities promptly arrest that fatal form of decomposition of
the animal fluids which is occasioned by snake-venom, which produces its
deadly effects in the same manner as a drop of yeast ferments the largest
mash. Alcohol checks this poisonous and deadly process and neutralizes its
effects. Thus, alcohol, although a noxious agent, possesses a special
curative influence in a morbid state of the human system; but its general
remedial effects do not entitle it to the rank of a hygienic agent. We
believe that medicine is undergoing a gradual change from the darkness of
the past, with its ignorance, superstition, and barbarism, to the light of
a glorious future. At each successive step in the path of progress,
medicine approaches one degree nearer the realm of an exact science. The
common object of the practitioners of all medical schools is the
alleviation of human suffering. The only difference between the schools is
in the remedies employed, the size of dose administered, and the results
attained. These are insufficient grounds for bitter sectarianism. We are
all fellow laborers in the same field. Before us lies a boundless expanse
for exploration. There are new conditions of disease to be learned, new
remedies to be discovered, and new properties of old ones to be
examined.</p>

<p>We do not deplore the fact, that there are different schools in
medicine, for this science has not reached perfection, and they tend to
stimulate investigation. The remarks of Herbert <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[pg 297]</span>Spencer on the
"Multiplication of Schemes of Juvenile Culture," may be pertinently applied
to the different schools in medicine with increased force. He says: "It is
clear that dissent in education results in facilitating inquiry by the
division in labor. Were we in possession of the true method, divergence
from it would, of course, be prejudicial; but the true method having to be
found, the efforts of numerous independent seekers carrying out their
researches in different directions, constitute a better agency for finding
it than any that could be devised. Each of them struck by some new thought
which probably contains more or less of basis in facts&mdash;each of them
zealous on behalf of his plan, fertile in expedients to test its
correctness, and untiring in its efforts to make known its success&mdash;each of
them merciless in its criticism on the rest&mdash;there cannot fail, by
composition of forces, to be a gradual approximation of all towards the
right course. Whatever portion of the normal method any one of them has
discovered, must, by the constant exhibition of its results, force itself
into adoption; whatever wrong practices he has joined with it must, by
repeated experiment and failure, be exploded. And by this aggregation of
truths and elimination of errors, there must eventually be developed a
correct and complete body of doctrine. Of the three phases through which
human opinion passes&mdash;the unanimity of the ignorant, the disagreement of
the inquiring, and the unanimity of the wise&mdash;it is manifest that the
second is the parent of the third."</p>

<p>We believe the time is coming when those maladies which are now
considered fatal will be readily cured&mdash;when disease will be disarmed of
its terrors. To be successful, a physician must be independent, free from
all bigotry, having no narrow prejudice against his fellow-men, liberal,
accepting new truths from whatever source they come, free from restrictions
of societies, and an earnest laborer in the interests of the Great
Physician.</p>

<h2><a name='IIICHAPTER_II'></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h1>REMEDIES FOR DISEASE.</h1>


<p>It will be our aim, throughout this book, to prescribe such remedies as
are within the easy reach of all, and which may be safely employed. Many of
those of the vegetable class are indigenous to this country, and may be
procured in their strength and purity, at the proper season, by those
residing in the localities where they grow, while all others advised may be
obtained at any good drug-store. We shall endeavor to recommend such as can
be procured and prepared with the least trouble and expense to the patient,
when it is believed that they will be equally as efficacious as more
expensive medicines.</p>


<h4>PROPRIETARY MEDICINES.</h4>


<p>Having the invalid's best interests in view, it will often happen that
we cannot prescribe better or cheaper remedies nor those which are more
effective or easily obtained, than some of our standard preparations, which
are sold by all druggists. We are aware that there is a popular, and not
altogether unfounded prejudice against "patent medicines," owing to the
small amount of merit which many of them possess. The term "Patent
Medicine" does not apply to Dr. Pierce's remedies, as no patent has ever
been asked or obtained for them, nor have they been urged upon the public
as "cure alls." They are simply favorite prescriptions, which, in a very
extensive practice, have proved their superior remedial virtues in the cure
of the diseases for which they are recommended.</p>

<p>From the time of Hippocrates down to the present day, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[pg
299]</span>physicians have classified diseases according to their causes,
character or symptoms. It has been proved that diseases apparently
different may often be cured by the same remedy. The reason for this
singular fact is obvious. A single remedy may possess a variety of
properties. Quinine, among other properties has a tonic which suggests its
use in cases of debility; an antiperiodic, which renders it efficient in
ague; and an anti-febrile property, which renders it efficacious in cases
of fever. The result produced varies with the quantity given, the time of
its administration, and the circumstances under which it is employed. Every
practicing physician has his favorite remedies, which he oftenest
recommends or uses, because he has the greatest confidence in their
virtues. The patient does not know their composition. Even prescriptions
are usually written in a language unintelligible to anybody but the
druggist. As much secrecy is employed as in the preparation of proprietary
medicines. Does the fact that an article is prepared by a process known
only to the manufacturer render that article less valuable? How many
physicians know the elementary composition of the remedies which they
employ, some of which never have been analyzed? Few practitioners know how
morphine, quinine, podophyllin, leptandrin, pepsin, or chloroform, are
made, or how nauseous drugs are transformed into palatable elixirs; yet
they do not hesitate to employ them. Is it not inconsistent to use a
prescription the composition of which is unknown to us, and discard another
preparation simply because it is accompanied by a printed statement of its
properties with directions for its use?</p>

<p>Various journals in this country, have at different times published
absurd formul&aelig; purporting to be receipts for the preparation of "Dr.
Sage's Catarrh Remedy" and Dr. Pierce's standard medicines, which, in most
instances, have not contained a single ingredient which enters into the
composition of these celebrated remedies.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of any pharmaceutical preparation, two conditions are
essential to its perfection, viz: purity and strength of the materials, and
appropriate machinery. The first is insured, by purchasing the materials in
large quantities, whereby the exercise of greater care in selecting the
ingredients can be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300"
id="Page_300"></a>[pg 300]</span>afforded; and the second can only be
accomplished where the business is extensive enough to warrant a large
outlay of capital in procuring proper chemical apparatus. These facts apply
with especial force to the manufacture of our medicines, their quality
having been vastly improved since the demand has become so great as to
require their manufacture in very large quantities. Some persons, while
admitting that our medicines are good pharmaceutical compounds, object to
them on the ground that they are too often used with insufficient judgment.
We propose to obviate that difficulty by enlightening the people as to the
structure and functions of their bodies, the causes, character, and
symptoms of disease, and by indicating the proper and judicious employment
of our medicines, together with such auxiliary treatment as may be
necessary. Such is one of the designs of this volume.</p>


<h4>PROPERTIES OF MEDICINE.</h4>


<p>It is generally conceded that the action of a remedy upon the human
system depends upon properties peculiar to it. The effects produced suggest
the naming of these qualities, which have been scientifically classified.
We shall name the diseases from their characteristic symptoms, and then,
without commenting upon all the properties of a remedy, recommend its
employment. Our reference to the qualities of any remedy, when we do make a
particular allusion to them, we shall endeavor to make as easy and familiar
as possible.</p>

<p><b>Dose</b>. All persons are not equally susceptible to the influence of
medicines. As a rule, women require smaller doses than men, and children
less than women. Infants are very susceptible to the effects of anodynes,
even out of all relative proportion to other kinds of medicines. The
circumstances and conditions of the system increase or diminish the effects
of medicine, so that an aperient at one time may act as a cathartic at
another, and a dose that will simply prove to be an anodyne when the
patient is suffering great pain will act as a narcotic when he is not. This
explains why the same dose often affects individuals differently. The
following table is given to indicate the size of the dose, and is graduated
to the age.</p>

<p>The doses mentioned in the following pages are those for adults, except
when otherwise specified.</p>

<p><b>The Preparation of Medicines.</b>  The remedies which we shall
mention for domestic use are mostly vegetable. Infusions and decoctions of
these will often be advised on account of the fact that they are more
available than the tinctures, fluid extracts, and concentrated principles,
which we prefer, and almost invariably employ in our practice. Most of
these medical extracts are prepared in our chemical laboratory under the
supervision of a careful and skilled pharmaceutist. No one, we presume,
would expect, with only a dish of hot water and a stew-kettle, to equal in
pharmaceutical skill the learned chemist with all his ingeniously devised
and costly apparatus for extracting the active, remedial principles from
medicinal plants. Yet infusions and decoctions are not without their value;
and from the inferior quality of many of the fluid extracts and other
pharmaceutical preparations in the market, it may be questioned whether the
former are not frequently as valuable as the latter. So unreliable are a
majority of the fluid extracts, tinctures, and concentrated, active
principles found in the drug-stores, that we long since found it necessary
to have prepared in our laboratory, most of those which we employ. To the
reliability of the preparations which we secure in this way we largely
attribute our great success in the treatment of disease. Tinctures and
fluid extracts are often prepared from old and worthless roots, barks, and
herbs which have wholly lost their medicinal properties. Yet they are sold
at just as high prices as those which are good. We manufacture our
tinctures, fluid extracts, and concentrated, active principles from roots,
barks, and herbs which are fresh, and selected with the greatest care. Many
of the crude roots, barks, and herbs found in the market are inactive
because they have been gathered at the wrong season. These, together with
those that have been kept on hand so long as to have lost all medicinal
value, are often sold <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302"
id="Page_302"></a>[pg 302]</span>in large quantities, and at reduced
prices, to be manufactured into fluid extracts and tinctures. Of course,
the preparations made from such materials are worthless. Whenever the dose
of fluid extracts, tinctures, and concentrated, active principles, is
mentioned in this chapter, the quantity advised is based upon our
experience in the use of these preparations, as they are made in our
laboratory, and the smallest quantity which will produce the desired effect
is always given. When using most of the preparations found in the
drug-stores, the doses have to be somewhat increased, and even then they
will not always produce the desired effect, for reasons already given.</p>

<p><b>The List of Medicines</b> which we shall introduce in this chapter
will be quite limited, as we cannot hope, by making it extensive, that the
non-professional reader would be able to prescribe with good judgment any
other than the simpler remedies. Hence, we prefer, since we have not space
in this volume to waste, to mention only a few of the most common remedies
under each head or classification.</p>

<p><b>Tinctures.</b> Very uniform and reliable tinctures may be made of
most indigenous plants, by procuring the part to be employed, at the proper
season, while it is green and fresh, bruising it well, and covering it with
good strong whiskey, or with alcohol diluted with one part of water to
three of alcohol, corking tightly, and letting it stand about fourteen
days, when the tincture may be filtered or poured off from the drugs, and
will be ready for use. Prepared in this imperfect manner, they rill be
found to be much more reliable than any of the fluid extracts found in the
drug-stores. An excess of the crude drug should be used in preparing the
tincture to insure a perfect saturation of the alcohol with its active
principles.</p>

<p><b>Homoeopathic Tinctures.</b> The tinctures prepared by several of the
German and French pharmaceutists, and called by them "Mother Tinctures," to
distinguish them from the dilutions made therefrom, we have found to be
very reliable, so much superior to any similar preparations made in this
country that we purchase from them all we use of Pulsatilla, Staphisagria,
Drosera and several others. They are prepared with great care from the
green, crude material, and although high in price, when compared with other
tinctures, yet the greater <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303"
id="Page_303"></a>[pg 303]</span>certainty of action which we secure in our
prescriptions by their employment more than repays for the expense and
trouble in procuring them, for of what account is expense to the true
physician when <i>life</i> may depend upon the virtue of the agent he
employs?</p>

<p><b>Infusions.</b> These are generally made by adding one-half ounce of
the crude medicine to a pint of water, which should be closely covered,
kept warm, and used as directed. Flowers, leaves, barks, and roots become
impaired by age, and it is necessary to increase or diminish the dose
according to the strength of the article employed.</p>

<p><b>Decoctions.</b> The difference between a decoction and an infusion
is, that the plant or substance is boiled in the production of the former,
in order to obtain its soluble, medicinal qualities. Cover the vessel
containing the ingredients, thus confining the vapor, and shutting out the
atmospheric air which sometimes impairs the active principles and their
medicinal qualities. The ordinary mode of preparing a decoction is to use
one ounce of the plant, root, bark, flower, or substance to a pint of
water. The dose internally varies from a tablespoonful to one ounce.</p>


<h4>ALTERATIVES.</h4>


<p>Alteratives are a class of medicines which in some inexplicable manner,
gradually change certain morbid actions of the system, and establish a
healthy condition instead. They stimulate the vital processes to renewed
activity, and arouse the excretory organs to remove matter which ought to
be eliminated. They facilitate the action of the secretory glands, tone
them up, and give a new impulse to their operations, so that they can more
expeditiously rid the system of worn-out and effete materials. In this way
they alter, correct, and purify the fluids, tone up the organs, and
re-establish their healthy functions. Alteratives may possess tonic,
laxative, stimulant, or diuretic properties all combined in one agent. Or
we may combine several alteratives, each having only one of these
properties in one remedy. We propose to enumerate only a few alteratives,
and give the doses which are usually prescribed; the list which we employ
in our practice is very extensive, but it cannot be made available for
domestic use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>[pg
304]</span><b>Mandrake</b> (<i>Podophyllum Peltatum</i>), also called
May-apple, is a most valuable alterative. The root is the part used.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of decoction, one to two teaspoonfuls; of tincture, six to
eight drops; of fluid extract, three to five drops; of its active
principle, Podophyllin, one-twelfth to one-eighth of a grain.</p>

<p><b>Poke</b> (<i>Phytolacca Decandra</i>), also called Skoke, Garget, or
Pigeon-berry, is a valuable alterative. The root is the part used.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of decoction, one to three teaspoonfuls; of fluid extract,
three to ten drops; of concentrated principle, Phytolaccin, one-fourth to
one grain.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Dock</b> (<i>Rumex Crispus</i>), The part used is the root.

in scrofula, syphilis, cutaneous and all blood diseases. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of
decoction, one or two tablespoonfuls <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>[pg 305]</span>from three to five times
daily; of tincture, one or two teaspoonfuls; of fluid extract, one-half to
one teaspoonful; of concentrated principle, Alnuin, one-half to one
grain.</p>

Black Cohosh. </p>

<p><b>Black Cohosh</b> (<i>Macrotys or Cimicifuga Racemosa</i>) The part
used is the root. Its other common names are Black Snake-root, or
Squaw-root. Black Cohosh is an alterative stimulant, nervine, diaphoretic,
tonic, and a cerebro-spinal stimulant. It is a useful remedy.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of decoction, one-fourth to <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[pg 306]</span>one ounce; of tincture,
ten to fifteen drops; of fluid extract, five to ten drops; of the
concentrated principle, Macrotin, one-eighth to one-half grain.</p>

Blood-root. </p>

<p><b>Blood-root</b> (<i>Sanguinaria Canadensis</i>), is also known as Red
Puccoon. The part used is the root. In minute doses Blood-root is a
valuable alterative, acting upon the biliary secretion and improving the
circulation and digestion. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of powdered root, one-fourth to
one-half grain; of tincture, one <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307"
id="Page_307"></a>[pg 307]</span>to two drops; of the fluid extract,
one-half to one drop. When given in a fluid form it should be well
diluted.</p>

<p><b>Burdock</b> (<i>Arctium Lappa</i>). The root is the part used.
Burdock is a valuable alterative in diseases of the blood. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of
tincture, from one teaspoonful to a tablespoonful twenty minutes before
meals; of fluid extract, one to two teaspoonfuls.</p>

<p><b>Blue Flag</b> (<i>Iris Versicolor</i>). The part used is the root.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the tincture, five to ten drops; of fluid extract, three to
ten drops; of concentrated principle, Iridin, one-half to two grains.</p>

<p><b>Sweet Elder</b> (<i>Sambucus Canadensis</i>). Sweet Elder-flowers are
a valuable alterative, diuretic, mucous and glandular stimulant, excellent
in eruptive, cutaneous, and scrofulous diseases of children. An infusion,
fluid extract, or syrup, may be used in connection with the "Golden Medical
Discovery." Both will be found valuable for cleansing the blood and
stimulating the functions to a healthy condition. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the
infusion of the flowers, from one-half to one ounce, if freely taken, will
operate as a laxative; of fluid extract, one-fourth to one-half
teaspoonful. The flowers, or inner bark of the root, simmered in fresh
butter, make a good ointment for most cutaneous affections.</p>

<p><b>Iodine.</b> This agent, in the several forms of Iodide of Potassium,
Iodide of Ammonium, Iodide of Iron, and Iodide of Lime, is largely employed
by physicians, and often with most happy results. But for domestic use we
cannot advise its employment, as it is liable to injure the invalid, when
its action is carried too far, which is apt to be the case, when not
administered under the supervision of a competent physician.</p>

<p><b>Mercury.</b> The various preparations of mercury have a profound,
alterative effect upon the system. When taken for some time, they change
the quality and composition of the blood; cause a diminution in the number
of red blood-corpuscles, and an increase in the various effete materials.
In the vast majority of cases we prefer the vegetable alteratives, but in
rare instances they exert a beneficial influence, in small doses. None of
the preparations of mercury should be taken internally without the advice
of a skillful physician, therefore, we shall not give their doses.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[pg
308]</span><h4>THE COMPOUNDING OF ALTERATIVES.</h4>


<p>The efficacy of this class of remedies can be greatly increased by
properly combining several of them into one compound.</p>

<p>This requires a knowledge of Pharmaceutical Chemistry; <i>i.e.</i>, the
preparation of compounds founded on the chemical relation and action of
their several remedial, active principles. Many practitioners make
combinations of remedies which neutralize each other's influence, instead
of extending their efficacy and curative power.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Pierce's "Golden Medical Discovery</b>," or Alterative Extract.
This compound is a highly nutritive and tonic preparation, combining the
remedial properties of the best vegetable alteratives at present known to
the medical profession. In perfecting this alterative compound, and
likewise other standard preparations of medicine, we have made an outlay of
many thousand dollars for chemical apparatus, and special machinery by the
aid of which these remedies have been brought to their present perfection.
Great pains are taken to obtain the materials at the right season of the
year, properly cured so that none of their remedial qualities may be
impaired. We, therefore, can with great confidence recommend Dr. Pierce's
"Golden Medical Discovery" as one of the best preparations of the
alterative class. Like all others of this type, its action is insensible,
producing gradual changes, arousing the excretory glands to remove morbid
materials, and at the same time toning the secretory organs. The
manufacture of this compound is under the special supervision of a
competent chemist and pharmaceutist, and it is now put up in bottles
wrapped with full directions for its use. We can confidently recommend this
compound whenever an alterative is required to cleanse the blood, tone the
system, increase its nutrition, and establish a healthy condition. For
these reasons we shall often advise its employment.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Purgative Pellets</b>. These pellets combine
the pure, concentrated, active principles of several vegetable alteratives,
and the result is, that within the small compass of a few grains he has
most happily blended and chemically condensed these properties so that
their action upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309"
id="Page_309"></a>[pg 309]</span>the <b>animal economy</b> is sanative and
universal. They awaken the latent powers, quicken the tardy functions,
check morbid deposits, dissolve hard concretions, remove obstructions,
promote depuration, harmonize and restore the functions, equalize the
circulation, and encourage the action of the nervous system. They stimulate
the glands, increase the peristaltic movement of the intestines, tone the
nutritive processes, while aiding in evacuating the bowels. All this they
accomplish without corroding the tissues or vitiating the fluids. Their
assistance is genial, helping the system to expel worn out materials, which
would become noxious if retained. Having expended their remedial powers
upon the various functions of the body, they are themselves expelled along
with other waste matter, leaving behind them no traces of irritation. This
cannot be said of mercurials, or of other harsh, mineral alteratives. These
Pellets may be safely employed when the system is feeble, frail, and
delicate, by giving them in less quantities. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;As an alterative,
only one or two Pellets should be taken daily.</p>


<h4>ALKALIES.</h4>


<p><b>Alkalies</b>. These constitute an important list of remedial agents,
their administration being frequently indicated. The employment of other
medicines frequently should be preceded by the administration of an agent
of this class, to neutralize excessive acidity in the stomach and bowels.
Unless this be done, many medicines will fail to produce their specific
effects.</p>

<p><b>Sulphite of Soda</b>  (<i>Sod&aelig; Sulphis</i>). This salt, as well as
the Hyposulphite of Soda, is not only generally preferable for
administration on account of its unirritating character and the smallness
of the dose required, but also because it is a valuable antiseptic agent.
The <i>Sulphite</i> should not be confounded with the <i>Sulphate</i> of
Soda (Glauber's Salt). <i>Dose</i>&mdash;This is from three to ten grains.</p>

<p><b>Saleratus</b> (<i>Potassoe Bicarbonas</i>). This is a favorite
domestic antacid. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Five to fifteen grains is the amount.</p>


<h4>ACIDS.</h4>


<p>As alkalies are important and often indicated as remedial agents, acids,
so their re-agents, acids, are also frequently <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>[pg 310]</span>necessary to meet opposite
conditions of the fluids of the system.</p>

<p><b>Hydrochloric or Muriatic Acid.</b> This agent may be administered in
doses of from five to ten drops, largely diluted in water or gruel.</p>

<p><b>Aromatic Sulphuric Acid,</b> or Elixir of Vitriol, is the most
agreeable form of Sulphuric Acid for administration, and may be given in
doses of from five to fifteen drops, largely diluted with water.</p>

<p>In taking acids, they should be sucked through a straw, and not allowed
to come in contact with the teeth, as otherwise the latter organs will be
injured by their effects; or should the acid come in contact with the
teeth, the mouth should be immediately rinsed with a solution of saleratus
or soda, to neutralize the acid.</p>


<h4>ANODYNES.</h4>


<p>Anodynes are those medicines which relieve pain by blunting the
sensibility of the nerves, or of the brain, so that it does not appreciate
the morbid sensation. An anodyne may be a stimulant in one dose, and a
narcotic in a larger one. The properties of different anodyne agents vary,
consequently they produce unlike effects. The size of the dose required,
differs according to circumstances and condition. An adult, suffering acute
pain, requires a much larger dose to produce an anodyne effect than one who
is a chronic sufferer. An individual accustomed to the use of anodynes,
requires a much larger dose to procure relief than one who is not. Doses
may be repeated, until their characteristic effects are produced, after an
interval of thirty or forty minutes. When the stomach is very sensitive and
will not tolerate their internal administration, one-sixth of a grain of
Morphia can be inserted beneath the skin, by means of a hypodermic syringe.
Relief is more quickly experienced, and the anodyne effect is much more
lasting than when taken into the stomach.</p>

<p><b>Opium</b> (<i>Papaver Somniferum).</i> Opium is a stimulant, anodyne,
or narcotic, according to the size of the dose administered.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the dry powder, one-fourth to one grain; of tincture
(Laudanum), five to fifteen drops; of camphorated tincture (Paregoric),
one-half to one teaspoonful; of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[pg
311]</span>Morphine, one-eighth to one-fourth grain; of Dover's Powder
three to five grains.</p>

<p><b>Hyoscyamus</b> (<i>Hyoscyamus Niger</i>), commonly known as Henbane.
The herb is used. It is a powerful narcotic, and unlike Opium, does not
constipate the bowels, but possesses a laxative tendency. Therefore, it may
be employed as an anodyne for allaying pain, calming the mind, inducing
sleep and arresting spasms, when opiates are inadmissible. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of
alcoholic extract, one-half to two grains; of fluid extract, five to ten
drops; of the concentrated principle, Hyoscyamin, one-twelfth to one-fourth
of a grain.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise098"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 116. Poison Hemlock. " src="images/advise098.png" /></a><br />Fig.
116. Poison Hemlock. </p>

<p><b>Poison Hemlock</b> (<i>Conium Maculatum</i>). The leaves are the
parts used. Poison Parsley, as it is sometimes called, is an anodyne,
narcotic, and an excellent alterative. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of fluid <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>[pg
312]</span>extract, two to six drops; of solid extract, one-fourth to
one-half grain.</p>

<p><b>Belladonna</b> (<i>Atropa Belladonna</i>) or Deadly Nightshade. The
herb or leaves are a valuable agent. In overdoses, it is an energetic,
narcotic poison. In medicinal doses it is anodyne, antispasmodic,
diaphoretic, and diuretic. It is excellent in neuralgia, epilepsy, mania,
amaurosis, whooping-cough, stricture, rigidity of the os uteri, and is
supposed by some to be a prophylactic or preventive of Scarlet Fever. Its
influence upon the nerve centers is remarkable. It relaxes the blood
vessels on the surface of the body and induces capillary congestion,
redness of the eye, scarlet appearance of the face, tongue, and body.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of fluid extract, one-half to one drop; of tincture, one to
two drops; of concentrated principle, Atropin, one-thirtieth to
one-sixteenth of a grain; of the <i>Alkaloid, Atropia</i>, one-sixtieth of
a grain. Even the most skillful chemists are very cautious in compounding
these latter active principles, and the danger of an overdose is great.</p>

<p><b>Camphor</b>. This drug is an anodyne, stimulant, and diaphoretic,
and, in large doses, a narcotic and an irritant. It is an excellent
stimulant for liniments. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the powder, one to five grains; of
the tincture, ten to twenty drops, given in simple syrup.</p>

<p><b>Hops</b> (<i>Humulus Lupulus</i>). This is an excellent remedy in
wakefulness, and may be used when opium is contra-indicated. A bag of the
leaves, moistened with whiskey and placed as a pillow under the head, acts
as an anodyne. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the infusion of the leaves, from one to four
ounces; of the fluid extract, one-fourth to three-fourths of a teaspoonful;
of the concentrated principle, Humulin, one to three grains.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-weed</b>. This anodyne
compound is made by uniting several of the most valuable agents of this
class, and its medicinal qualities are rendered still more efficacious by
the addition of certain stimulating articles. It is free from narcotic
properties which are liable to produce deleterious results, and has been
found to be not only harmless in its action, but very genial and effectual
withal, and most reliable as a stimulant and diaphoretic remedy.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>[pg
313]</span><h4>ANTHELMINTICS.</h4>


<p>Anthelmintic means "against a worm," and is a term employed to designate
those medicines which destroy or expel worms. It means the same as
<i>Vermifuge</i>. Little is understood concerning the origin of worms.
There are five distinct varieties described by authors as being more common
than others. There is the long worm, the short, or pin-worm, the
thread-worm, the tape-worm, and the broad tape-worm peculiar to some
countries of Europe. Irritation of the alimentary canal, from whatever
cause usually produces an abundant secretion of mucus, which is thought to
be a condition favorable for their production. Therefore, those medicines
which remove the cause of this irritation tend to diminish the number, if
not to entirely destroy the worms. Some medicines kill the worms, others
expel them alive. The remedies which successfully remove one kind of worm,
have little effect upon another, and to meet these different conditions, we
have a variety of worm-destroying medicines. The pin-worm, inhabits the
rectum, and may be destroyed by injecting into it a strong solution of
salt, or decoction of aloes, and when it is allowed to pass away, the
rectum should be anointed with vaseline, butter, or lard. The eggs of this
worm are developed around the orifice of the large intestine, and when this
latter precaution is not practiced every time there is a passage from the
bowels, they will multiply as rapidly as they can be destroyed. Generally,
vermifuge remedies should be taken when the stomach is empty, and should be
followed by the administration of a cathartic in two hours after the last
dose is administered.</p>

<p><b>Santonin</b>. This is decidedly the most reliable anthelmintic known
to the medical profession. It is deservedly a popular remedy for worms, and
when combined with Podophyllin, is very efficacious in removing the
pin-worm. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;For an adult, two to three grains of the powdered
Santonin, repeated every three hours until four or five doses are taken,
when it should be followed by a cathartic.</p>

<p><b>Sage</b> (<i>Salvia Officinalis</i>). Sage is a common and excellent
domestic remedy for worms. Make an infusion of Sage and Senna leaves, and
drink freely until it acts as a cathartic.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>[pg 314]</span>


<p class="figure"><a name="advise099"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 117. Pink Root." src="images/advise099.png" /></a><br />Fig. 117. Pink
Root.</p>

<p><b>Pink-root</b> (<i>Spigelia Marilandica</i>). Pink-root is one of the
most active and certain anthelmintics for children. It is indigenous to the
United States. When taken in too large quantities, it is apt to purge, give
rise to vertigo, dimness of vision, and even to convulsions; therefore, it
should be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>[pg
315]</span>combined with some cathartic. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the infusion, one
ounce at night, followed by physic in the morning.</p>

<p><b>Common Salt</b> (<i>Chloride of Sodium</i>). Common table salt is an
anthelmintic, and may be used in an emergency. Salt water is a very common
domestic remedy for worms. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;In solution, one-quarter to
one-half teaspoonful.</p>

<p><b>Balmony</b> (<i>Chelone Glabra</i>). This is also tonic and
anthelmintic, and is valuable in debility, dyspepsia, jaundice, and hepatic
affections. It also is known as Snake-head. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the infusion,
one to two ounces; of the concentrated principle, Chelonin, from half to
one grain.</p>

<p><b>Male Fern</b> (<i>Aspidium Filix Mas</i>). Male Fern is the
anthelmintic which is considered especially effectual in removing the
tape-worm. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the powder, one to two drachms, given morning
and evening in syrup, followed by a brisk cathartic. The dose of the
tincture of the buds in ether is from eight to thirty drops.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise100"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 118. Aspen." src="images/advise100.png" /></a><br />Fig. 118.
Aspen.</p>

<p><b>Poplar</b> (<i>Populus Tremuloides</i>). The White or Aspen Poplar is
a common tree, and contains active principles termed Populin and Salicin,
both of which are tonic. An infusion of the bark is a remedy for worms.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the tea made from the bark, one to four ounces; of Populin,
from one-half to two grains.</p>


<h4>ANTIPERIODICS.</h4>


<p>It is well understood that malarial diseases are characterized by a
periodicity which indicates their nature. Antiperiodics prevent the
recurrence of the periodic manifestations, and hence their name.</p>

<p><b>Quinine</b> (<i>Sulphate of Quinia</i>). Quinine is a tonic,
febrifuge, and antiperiodic. It should generally be administered during the
intervals between the febrile paroxysms. It is beneficial also in all
diseases accompanied by debility. The dose varies from one to six grains
according to indications. Frequently it is given in much <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>[pg 316]</span>larger
quantities, but we cannot advise such for domestic use.</p>

<p><b>Prussian Blue</b> (<i>Ferri Ferrocyanidum</i>). Ferrocyanide of Iron
is an excellent tonic and antiperiodic remedy, and often is combined with
quinine. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;From two to five grains.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise101"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 119. Boneset. " src="images/advise101.png" /></a><br />Fig. 119.
Boneset. </p>

<p><b>Boneset</b> (<i>Eupatorium Perfoliatum</i>), or Thoroughwort. This is
tonic, diaphoretic, aperient, and possesses some antiperiodic properties;
the warm infusion is emetic. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the infusion, one to four
ounces; of the fluid extract, from half to one teaspoonful; of the active
principle, Eupatorin, one to three grains.</p>

<p><b>The "Golden Medical Discovery"</b> has gained an enviable reputation
in malarial districts for the cure of ague. From observing its action in
the cure of this and other miasmatic diseases, and knowing its composition,
we are thoroughly <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317"
id="Page_317"></a>[pg 317]</span>satisfied that it contains chemical
properties which neutralize and destroy the miasmatic or ague poison which
is in the system, and, at the same time, produces a rapid excretion of the
neutralized poisons. One strong proof of this is found in the fact that
persons who are cured with it are not so liable to relapse as those in whom
the chills are broken with Quinine or other agents. No bad effects are
experienced after an attack of ague which has been cured with the "Golden
Medical Discovery." This cannot be said of Quinine, Peruvian Bark, Arsenic,
and Mercurials, which comprise nearly the whole list of remedies usually
resorted to by physicians for arresting ague. The "Golden Medical
Discovery" not only has the merit of being a certain antidote for miasmatic
diseases, but is pleasant to the taste, a matter of no small importance,
especially when administered to children. To break the chills, this
medicine should be taken in doses of four teaspoonfuls three times a day,
and if this treatment pursued for three days, does not entirely arrest the
chills, these doses may be repeated in alternation with five-grain doses of
quinine for the three succeeding days. But in no case should more than this
amount of the "Golden Medical Discovery" be given.</p>


<h4>ANTISEPTICS AND DISINFECTANTS.</h4>


<p>Antiseptics prevent, while disinfectants arrest putrefaction. Oxygen is
a natural disinfectant, but a powerful inciter of change. Although this
element is the cause of animal and vegetable decay, yet oxidation is the
grand process by which the earth, air, and sea are purified. A few
substances are both antiseptic and disinfectant. Heat up to a temperature
of 140&deg; Fahr. promotes putrescence, but above that point, is a drier or
disorganizer, and destroys the source of infection.</p>

<p><b>Yeast</b> (<i>Cerevisi&aelig; Fermentum</i>). Yeast is an antiseptic, and
is effective in all diseases in which there is threatened putridity. Used
externally, it is often combined with elm bark and charcoal, and applied to
ulcers, in which there is a tendency to gangrene. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;One
tablespoonful in wine or porter, once in two or three hours.</p>

<p><b>Creasote</b>. This is a powerful antiseptic. It is used in a <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>[pg
318]</span>solution of glycerine, oil, water, or syrup. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;One to
two drops, largely diluted.</p>

<p><b>Carbolic Acid</b> is a crystalline substance resembling creasote in
its properties. It is an antiseptic, and is used both internally and
externally. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;One-fourth to one-half drop of the melted
crystals, very largely diluted. Externally, in solution, one to five grains
of the crystals to one ounce of the solvent.</p>

<p><b>White Vitriol</b> (<i>Zinci Sulphas</i>). White vitriol is a valuable
disinfectant, as it will arrest mortification. In solution it is employed
in ulcers and cancers and also as a gargle in putrid sore throat.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;One-half to two grains in a pill; in solution, one to ten
grains in an ounce of water.</p>

<p><b>Permanganate of Potash</b> (<i>Potassoe Permanganas</i>). This
substance is an energetic deodorizer and disinfectant. A solution
containing from one to twenty grains in an ounce of water is used as a
lotion for foul ulcers. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;One-eighth to one-fourth of a
grain.</p>

<p><b>Wild Indigo</b> (<i>Baptisia Tinctoria</i>). The root is the part
used. This plant possesses valuable antiseptic properties. It is an
excellent lotion for ill-conditioned ulcers, malignant sore throat, nursing
sore-mouth, syphilitic ophthalmia, etc. It is sometimes administered in
scarlet and typhus fevers, and in all diseases in which there is a tendency
to putrescence. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the infusion, one-fourth to one-half ounce;
of the fluid extract, from three to ten drops, and of the concentrated,
active principle of the plant, Baptisin, from one to two grains.</p>


<h4>ANTISPASMODICS.</h4>


<p>Antispasmodics are a class of remedies which relieve cramps,
convulsions, and spasms, and are closely allied to nervines. Indeed some
authors class them together. The following are a few of the most important
antispasmodics:</p>

<p><b>Assafetida</b> (<i>Assafetida Ferula</i>). This is a powerful
antispasmodic. It is employed in hysteria, hypochondria, convulsions, and
spasms, when unaccompanied by inflammation. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the gum or
powder, from three to ten grains, usually administered in the form of a
pill; of the tincture, from one-half to one teaspoonful.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>[pg 319]</span>


<p class="figure"><a name="advise102"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 120. Yellow Jessamine." src="images/advise102.png" /></a><br />Fig.
120. Yellow Jessamine.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Jessamine</b> (<i>Gelseminum Sempervirens</i>). The root is
the part used. This is a valuable remedy in various diseases when associated
with restlessness and a determination of the
blood to the brain; also in the neuralgia. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>[pg 320]</span>fluid
extract, three to eight drops; of the concentrated principle, Gelsemin,
one-fourth to one grain. The use of this drug by non-professional persons
should be attended with great caution.</p>

<p><b>Valerian</b> (<i>Valeriana Officinalis</i>). The root is the part
used. Valerian is an effective remedy in cases of nervousness and
restlessness. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the infusion, (one-half ounce to a pint of
water) one-half ounce; of the tincture, one-half to two tablespoonfuls; of
the ammoniated tincture of valerian, from one-half to two teaspoonfuls in
sweetened water or milk; of the valerianate of ammonia, one-half to three
grains.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Lady's Slipper</b> (<i>Cypripedium Pubescens</i>). The root is
the part used. This is a useful remedy in hysteria, chorea, and all cases
of irritability. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the powder, fifteen to thirty grains; of
the infusion, one ounce; of the fluid extract, fifteen to thirty drops; of
the concentrated principle, Cypripedin, one-half to two grains.</p>

<p><b>Wild Yam</b> (<i>Dioscorea Villosa</i>). The root is the part used.
This is a powerful antispasmodic, and has been successfully used in bilious
colic, nausea, and spasm of the bowels. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the infusion (two
ounces to a pint of water), one to two ounces; of the fluid extract, five
to fifteen drops; of the concentrated principle, Dioscorein, one-half to
one grain.</p>

<p><b>High Cranberry</b> (<i>Viburnum Opulus.</i>) The bark is the part
used. It is also known as Cramp Bark. This is a powerful antispasmodic, and
is effective in relaxing spasms of all kinds. It is a valuable agent in
threatened abortion. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the infusion, one-half to one ounce;
of the fluid extract, one-half to one teaspoonful; of the concentrated
principle, Viburnin, one-half to two grains. These doses may be increased

<h4>ASTRINGENTS.</h4>


<p>Astringents are medicines which condense and coagulate the tissues,
thereby arresting discharges. When taken into the mouth, they produce the
sensation known as puckering. They are used internally and locally. The
term <i>styptic</i> is used as a synonym of astringent, but is generally
employed to designate those astringents which arrest hemorrhage, or
bleeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>[pg
321]</span><b>Logwood</b> (<i>Hoematoxylon Campechianum</i>). Logwood is a
mild astringent, well adapted to remedy the relaxed condition of the bowels
after cholera infantum. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of powdered extract, five to ten
grains; of the decoction, one ounce; of the fluid extract, fifteen to
thirty drops.</p>

<p><b>Blackberry Root</b>  (<i>Rubus Villosus</i>). This astringent is a
favorite, domestic remedy in affections of the bowels. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the

Witch-hazel. </p>

<p><b>Witch-hazel</b>  (<i>Hamamelis Virginica</i>). The parts used are the
leaves and bark. This is a most valuable astringent and exerts a specific
action upon the nervous system. It arrests many forms of uterine hemorrhage
with great promptness, is a valuable agent in the treatment of piles, and
is useful in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>[pg

<p><b>Canada Fleabane</b> (<i>Erigeron Canadense</i>). The leaves and
flowers are used. This plant, sometimes known as Colt's-tail, Pride-weed,
or Butter-weed, is astringent, and has been <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>[pg 325]</span>efficiently employed in
uterine hemorrhages. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the infusion (two ounces of the herb
to one pint of water), one to two ounces; of the oil, five to ten drops on
sugar, repeated at intervals of from one to four hours.</p>

<p><b>Catechu</b> (<i>Acacia Catechu</i>). A tincture of this plant is a
pure, powerful astringent, and is especially useful in chronic diarrhea,
chronic catarrh, and chronic dysentery. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the powder, five to
twenty grains; of the tincture, one-half to two teaspoonfuls.</p>

<p><b>Tannin</b> (<i>Acidum, Tannicum</i>). This acid has a wide range of
application. It is used as an astringent. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;One to five
grains.</p>

<p><b>Gallic Acid</b> (<i>Acidum Gallicum</i>). This remedy is used chiefly
in hemorrhages. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Three to five grains. In severe hemorrhages,
this quantity should be administered every half hour, until the bleeding is
checked.</p>


<h4>CARMINATIVES.</h4>


<p>Carminatives are medicines which allay intestinal pain, arrest or
prevent griping caused by cathartics and exert a general soothing effect.
They are aromatic, and to a certain extent, stimulant.</p>

<p><b>Anise-seed</b> (<i>Pimpinella Anisum</i>). Anise is a pleasant,
aromatic carminative, and is used in flatulent colic. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the
powdered seed, ten to fifteen grains; of the infusion (a teaspoonful of
seed to a gill of water), sweetened, may be given freely; of the oil, five
to ten drops on sugar.</p>

<p><b>Fennel-seed</b> (<i>Anethum Foeniculum</i>). This is one of our most
grateful aromatics, and is sometimes employed to modify the action of senna
and rhubarb. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Same as that of anise-seed.</p>

<p><b>Ginger</b> (<i>Zingiber Officinale</i>). The root is the part used.
This is a grateful stimulant and carminative. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the powder,
ten to twenty grains; of the infusion, one teaspoonful in a gill of water;
of the tincture, twenty to thirty drops; of the essence, ten to fifteen
drops; of the syrup, one teaspoonful.</p>

<p><b>Wintergreen</b> (<i>Gaultheria Procumbens</i>). The leaves are used.
This plant possesses stimulant, aromatic, and astringent properties. The
essence of Wintergreen is carminative, and is <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>[pg 326]</span>used in colics.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the essence, one-half to one teaspoonful in sweetened
water; of the oil, three to five drops on sugar.</p>

<p><b>Peppermint</b> (<i>Mentha Piperita</i>). Peppermint is a powerful
stimulant, carminative, and antispasmodic. It is used in the treatment of
spasms, colic, and hysteria. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;The infusion may be used freely.
The essence may be taken in doses of fifteen to thirty drops in sweetened
warm water; of the oil, one to five drops on sugar.</p>

<p><b>Spearmint</b> (<i>Mentha Viridis</i>). The carminative properties of
spearmint are inferior to those of peppermint, and its chief employment is
for its diuretic and febrifuge virtues. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Same as that of
peppermint.</p>

<p><b>Compound Extract of Smart-weed.</b> Dr. Pierce's Extract of
Smart-weed is a valuable carminative and aromatic stimulant, and has been
employed with marked success in all diseases in which this class of
remedies is required.</p>


<h4>CATHARTICS.</h4>


<p><i>Cathartics</i>, or <i>Purgatives</i> are medicines which act upon the
bowels and increase the secretions and evacuations. In many parts of the
country, these agents are known as purges, or physics. They have been
variously divided and subdivided, usually with reference to the energy of
their operations or the character of the evacuations produced.</p>

<p><i>Laxatives</i>, or <i>Aperients</i>, are mild cathartics. Purgatives
act with more energy and produce several discharges which are of a more
liquid character and more copious than the former.</p>

<p><i>Drastics</i> are those cathartics which produce numerous evacuations
accompanied by more or less intestinal irritation.</p>

<p><i>Hydragogues</i> are those purgatives which produce copious, watery
discharges.</p>

<p><i>Cholagogues</i> are those purgatives which act upon the liver,
stimulating its functions. Cathartics constitute a class of remedies which
are almost universally employed by families and physicians.</p>

<p><b>Jalap</b> (<i>Ipomoea Jalapa</i>). The root is used. It is a drastic
and a hydragogue cathartic. Formerly it was combined with equal parts of
calomel. From this fact it received the name of "ten and ten."
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the powder, five to twenty grains; <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>[pg 327]</span>of the fluid extract, ten
to fifteen drops; of the solid extract, two to four grains; of the
concentrated principle, Jalapin, one-half to two grains.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise108"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 126. Culver's-root. " src="images/advise108.png" /></a><br />Fig. 126.
Culver's-root. </p>

<p><b>Gamboge</b> (<i>Gambogia</i>). The gum is used. Gamboge is a powerful
drastic, hydragogue cathartic, which is apt to produce nausea and vomiting.
It is employed in dropsy. It should never be given alone, but combined with
milder cathartics. It accelerates their action while they moderate its
violence. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the powder, one-half to two grains. This
substance combined with aloes and sometimes with scammony, constitutes the
basis of the numerous varieties of large, cathartic pills found in the
market.</p>

<p><b>Culver's-root.</b> (<i>Leptandra Virginica</i>). The root is used.
This plant, known under the various names of Culver's Physic, Black-root,
Tall Speedwell, and Indian Physic, is a certain cholagogue, laxative, and
cathartic. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of decoction, one to two fluid ounces; of fluid
extract, ten to twenty drops; of tincture, twenty to thirty drops; of the
concentrated, active principle, Leptandrin, which is but feebly cathartic,
as a laxative, two to five grains.</p>

<p><b>Rhubarb</b> (<i>Rheum Palmatum</i>). This is much used as a domestic
remedy, and by the profession, for its laxative, tonic, and astringent
effects. It is employed in bowel complaints. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the powder,
ten to thirty grains; of the tincture, one-half to two teaspoonfuls; of the
fluid extract, ten to thirty drops; of the solid extract, three to five
grains; of the syrup, and aromatic <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328"
id="Page_328"></a>[pg 328]</span>syrup, an excellent remedy for children,
one-half to one teaspoonful.</p>

<p><b>Cascara Sagrada</b> (<i>Rhamnus Purshiana</i>), is a very efficient
remedy in chronic constipation. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the fluid extract, from ten
to twenty drops taken in a tablespoonful of water. The unpleasant taste may
be disguised with the extract of liquorice.</p>

<p><b>Castor Oil</b> (<i>Oleum Ricini</i>). <i>Dose</i>&mdash;From one to four
teaspoonfuls. It may be disguised by rubbing it with an equal quantity of
glycerine and adding one or two drops of oil of anise, cinnamon, or
wintergreen.</p>

<p><b>Butternut</b> (<i>Juglans Cinerea</i>). The bark is the part used.
Butternut is a mild cathartic, which resembles rhubarb in its property of
evacuating the bowels without irritating the alimentary canal.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the extract, as a cathartic, five to ten grains; of the
fluid extract, one-half to one teaspoonful; of the concentrated principle,
Juglandin, one to three grains. As a laxative, one-half of these quantities
is sufficient.</p>

<p><b>Aloes</b> (<i>Aloe</i>). The gum is used. This cathartic acts upon
the lower part of the bowels and sometimes causes piles; though some late
authors claim that in small doses it is a valuable remedy for piles.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;In powder or pill, three to ten grains; as a laxative, one to
three grains.</p>

<p><b>Epsom Salts</b> (<i>Magnesia Sulphas</i>). Its common name is
"Salts." Much used in domestic practice. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;One-fourth to
one-half ounce.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets,</b> being entirely vegetable in their
composition, operate without disturbance to the system, diet, or
occupation. Put up in glass vials. Always fresh and reliable. As <i>a
laxative, alterative,</i> or gently acting but searching <i>cathartic</i>,
these little Pellets give the most perfect satisfaction. Sick Headache,
Bilious Headache, Dizziness, Constipation, Indigestion, Bilious Attacks,
and all derangements of the stomach and bowels, are promptly relieved and
permanently cured by the use of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets. In
explanation of the remedial power of these Pellets over so great a variety
of diseases, it may truthfully be said that their action upon the system is
universal, not a gland or tissue escaping their sanative influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>[pg
329]</span>Everybody, now and then, needs a gentle laxative to assist
nature a little; or, a more searching and cleansing, yet gentle cathartic,
to remove offending matter from the stomach and bowels and tone up and
invigorate the liver and quicken its tardy action. Thereby the "Pleasant
Pellets" cure biliousness, sick and bilious headache, costiveness, or
constipation of the bowels, sour stomach, windy belchings, "heart-burn,"
pain and distress after eating, and kindred derangements of the liver,
stomach and bowels.</p>

<p>Persons subject to any of these troubles should never be without a vial
of the "Pleasant Pellets" at hand. In proof of their superior excellence it
can be truthfully said that they are always adopted as a household remedy
after the first trial.</p>

<p>The "Pleasant Pellets" are far more effective in arousing the liver to
action than "blue pills," the old-fashioned compound cathartic pills,
calomel or other mercurial preparations, and have the further merit of
being purely vegetable in their composition and perfectly harmless in any
condition of the system. Furthermore, no particular care is required while
using them.</p>

<p>Being composed of the choicest, concentrated vegetable extracts, their
cost of production is much more than that of most pills found in the
market, yet from forty to forty-four of them are put up in each glass vial,
as sold through druggists, and can be had at the price of the more ordinary
and cheaper made pills. Once used, they are always in favor. Their
secondary effect is to keep the bowels open and regular, not to further
constipate, as is the case with other pills. Hence, their great popularity
with sufferers from habitual constipation, piles and their attendant
discomfort and manifold derangements.</p>

<p>For all laxative and cathartic purposes the "Pleasant Pellets" are
infinitely superior to all "mineral waters," sediltz powders, "salts,"
castor oil, fruit syrups (so-called), laxative "teas," and the many other
purgative compounds sold in various forms.</p>

<p>If people generally, would pay more attention to properly regulating the
action of their bowels, they would have less frequent occasion to call for
their doctor's services to subdue attacks of dangerous diseases. Hence it
is of great importance to know what safe, harmless agent best serves the
purpose of producing the desired action.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>[pg
330]</span><h4>DIRECTIONS FOR USING DR. PIERCE'S PLEASANT PELLETS.</h4>


<p>In all cases, the size of dose to be taken must be regulated somewhat by
the known susceptibility of the individual to the action of laxative and
cathartic medicines. Some persons' bowels are readily acted upon by small
doses, while others require more. As a general rule, the smaller doses
which we recommend, are quite sufficient, and produce the best results if
persisted in for a reasonable length of time.</p>

<p>FOR A GENTLE APERIENT, OR LAXATIVE, take one or not more than two and
preferably in the morning, on an empty stomach.</p>

<p>FOR A GENTLE CATHARTIC, two or three are generally sufficient, if taken
in the morning, on an empty stomach.</p>

<p>FOR A VERY ACTIVE, SEARCHING CATHARTIC, four to six may be taken in the
morning, on an empty stomach.</p>

<p>FOR A CHILD OF TWO TO FOUR YEARS, one-half of a Pellet given in a little
sauce of some kind, or soft candy, will be sufficient for a laxative, or
one for a mild cathartic.</p>

<p>FOR A CHILD OF FOUR TO EIGHT YEARS, one for a laxative or two for a
cathartic will act nicely, if given on an empty stomach.</p>

<p>AS A DINNER PILL.&mdash;To promote digestion and increase the appetite, take
only one Pellet each day after dinner.</p>

<p><i>To overcome the disagreeable effects of a too hearty meal</i>, take
two Pellets as soon as conscious of having overloaded the stomach.</p>

<p>IN ALL CHRONIC DISEASES, it is of the utmost importance that the bowels
be kept <i>regular</i>, yet thorough purgation should be avoided, as it
tends to debilitate the system. Small laxative doses of one or at most two
Pellets, taken daily and continued for a long time, is the plan that we
would recommend to produce the best results.</p>

<p>IN DROPSY, an occasional active cathartic dose of the Pellets of say 4
to 6, taken once in a week or ten days, will do good, if, in the interval
between these doses, Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery be taken to
invigorate and regulate the system.</p>

<p>TO BREAK UP SUDDEN ATTACKS OF COLDS, FEVERS, AND INFLAMMATIONS.&mdash;It is
only in these sudden and severe attacks of <i>acute</i> diseases that we
recommend the Pellets to be taken in <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>[pg 331]</span>active purgative doses,
and in these cases <i>only one</i> large or cathartic dose of say 5 or 6
Pellets should be taken.</p>

<p>In colds, fevers, and inflammatory attacks, warm sweating teas should be
taken freely, and hot foot baths, or a hot general bath, employed to assist
in equalizing the circulation of the blood and restoring the equilibrium of
the system.</p>

<p>SUPPRESSED MENSTRUATION.&mdash;This combined treatment of an active dose of
Pellets, coupled with the use of a hot bath, foot bath, or, better still, a
hot sitz-bath, will bring on <i>menstruation</i>, when suppressed from
taking cold. In the latter case the effect will be insured if, in addition
to the use of the Pellets and baths, a full dose of Dr. Pierce's Compound
Extract of Smart-Weed, or Water Pepper, be also used.</p>


<h4>CAUSTICS.</h4>


<p><i>Caustics</i> are substances which have the power of destroying or
disorganizing animal structures. By their action they destroy the tissue to
which they are applied, and form a crust, which is thrown off by a
separation from the parts beneath. Their caustic property may be destroyed
by dilution with other substances, to such an extent that they will only
irritate or stimulate, and not destroy. Much care is necessary in their
employment, and it is not expected that the unprofessional reader will have
much to do with them; hence, we have deemed it best not to give a list of
these agents.</p>


<h4>COUNTER-IRRITANTS.</h4>


<p><i>Counter-irritants</i> are substances which produce irritation of the
part to which they are applied, varying in degree from a slight redness to
a blister or pustule. They are applied to the surface with a view of
producing an irritation to relieve irritation or inflammation in some other
or deeper seated part. They are a class of agents which we very seldom
employ, and, hence, we shall notice only a couple of the most simple.</p>

<p><b>Mustard</b> (<i>Sinapis</i>). The flour of mustard, which is best
adapted for domestic use, is employed in the form of a paste spread on
cloth. It takes effect in a few moments; the length of time it remains in
contact with the skin and the strength of the mustard determine the effect
produced.</p>

<p><b>Horse-radish</b> (<i>Cochlearia Armoracia</i>). The leaves are <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a>[pg 332]</span>the
parts used. Let them wilt and bind them on the part affected. They act
nearly as energetically as mustard.</p>


<h4>DIAPHORETICS.</h4>


<p><i>Diaphoretics</i> are medicines which increase perspiration. Those
which occasion profuse sweating are termed <i>Sudorifics</i>. The two terms
indicate different degrees of the same operation. They constitute an
important element in domestic practice, on account of the salutary effects
which generally follow their action. Their operation is favored by warmth
externally, and warm drinks, when they are not given in hot infusion.</p>

Pleurisy-root. </p>

<p><b>Pleurisy-root</b> (<i>Asclepias Tuberosa</i>), is also known as
White-root, and Butterfly-weed. It is a valuable remedy, well adapted to
break up inflammations and disease of the chest. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a>[pg 333]</span><i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of infusion,
one to two ounces; of fluid extract, one-fourth to one-half teaspoonful; of
the concentrated principle, Asclepin, one to three grains.</p>

<p><b>Saffron</b> (<i>Crocus Sativus</i>). Golden Saffron. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of
infusion (one drachm to a pint of water), one to two ounces.</p>

<p>Sage (<i>Salvia Officinalis</i>). The warm infusion drunk freely is a
valuable, domestic diaphoretic.</p>

<p><b>Virginia Snake-root</b>  (<i>Aristolochia Serpentaria</i>), is an
efficient agent. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of infusion, one to two ounces; of tincture,
one-fourth to one teaspoonful; of fluid extract, one-fourth to one-half
teaspoonful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>[pg
334]</span><b>Jaborandi</b> (<i>Pilocarpus Pinnatus</i>). Jaborandi
increases the flow of saliva, causes profuse perspiration, and lowers the
temperature of the body. In doses of from twenty to sixty drops of the
fluid extract, administered in a cup of warm water or herb-tea on going to
bed, we have found it very effectual for breaking up recent colds. We have
also found it valuable in whooping-cough, in doses of from three to ten
drops, according to the age of the child, given three or four times a day.
The fluid extract may be obtained at almost any drug-store.</p>

<p><b>May-Weed</b> (<i>Maruta Cotula</i>), is also known as Wild Chamomile,
and Dog-fennel. It is not much used, though it is a powerful diaphoretic.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of infusion, one to two ounces.</p>

<p><b>Catnip</b> (<i>Nepeta Cataria</i>). A deservedly popular, domestic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a>[pg
335]</span>remedy, always acceptable, and certain in its action. The warm
infusion is the best form for its administration. It may be drunk
freely.</p>

<p><b>Ginger</b> (<i>Zingiber Officinale</i>). The hot infusion may be
sweetened and drunk as freely as the stomach will bear.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-weed.</b> This is unsurpassed
as a diaphoretic agent, and is much more certain in its operation than any
simple diaphoretic.</p>


<h4>DILUENTS.</h4>


<p>Any fluid which thins the blood or holds medicine in solution is called
a diluent. Pure water is the principal agent of this class. It constitutes
about four-fifths of the weight of the blood, and is the most abundant
constituent of the bodily tissues. Water is necessary, not only for
digestion, nutrition, and all functional processes of life, but it is
indispensable as a menstruum for medicinal substances. It is a necessary
agent in depuration, or the process of purifying the animal economy, for it
dissolves and holds in solution deleterious matter, which in this state may
be expelled from the body. In fevers, water is necessary to quench the
thirst, promote absorption, and incite the skin and kidneys to action. Its
temperature may be varied according to requirements. Diluents are the
vehicles for introducing medicine into the system. We shall briefly mention
some which prove to be very grateful to the sick.</p>

<p><b>Various vegetable acids and jellies</b> may be dissolved in water, as
apple, currant, quince, grape, or cranberry.</p>

<p><b>The juice of lemons, oranges, pine-apples, and tamarinds,</b> is also
found to be refreshing to fever patients.</p>

<p><b>Sassafras-pith, slippery-elm bark, flax-seed, and gum arabic</b> make
good mucilaginous drinks for soothing irritation of the bowels and other
parts.</p>

<p><b>Brewers' yeast</b> mixed with water in the proportion of from
one-eighth to one-fourth is a stimulant and antiseptic.</p>

<p><b>The white ashes of hickory or maple wood</b> dissolved in water make
an excellent alkaline drink in fevers, or whenever the system seems
surcharged with acidity.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>[pg

Marsh-mallow. </p>

<p><b>Marsh-mallow</b> (<i>Althea Officinalis</i>) is used in irritable
conditions of the urinary organs. The infusion may be drunk freely.</p>

<p><b>Gravel-plant</b> (<i>Epigea Repens</i>), is also known as Water-pink,
Trailing-arbutus, or Gravel-root. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of decoction of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>[pg 337]</span>the
plant, one to three ounces; of fluid extract, one-fourth to one-half

<p><b>Stone-root</b> (<i>Collinsonia Canadensis</i>), is also known as
Knot-root, Horse-balm, Rich-weed, or Ox-balm. This is a mild diuretic, slow
in action, yet effective in allaying irritation of the bladder.
The root is the part used. _Dose_--If infusion, one to
two ounces; of fluid extract, five to ten drops; of the concentrated
principle, Collinsonin, one-half to one grain.
</p>

<p><b>Foxglove</b> (<i>Digitalis purpurea</i>) slows the action of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>[pg
338]</span>heart, lowers the temperature, and acts indirectly as a
diuretic. It is especially valuable in the treatment of scarlet fever and
in dropsy. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of infusion, one-half drachm to one-half ounce; of
the fluid extract or strong tincture, from two to ten drops. It should be
used with caution. A poultice made of the leaves and placed over the
kidneys is an effectual method of employing the drug.</p>

<p><b>Queen of the Meadow</b> (<i>Eupatorium Purpureum</i>), is also known
as Gravel-weed, Gravel-root, or Trumpet-weed. This is a most valuable
diuretic. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the infusion, one to three ounces; of fluid
extract, one-fourth to one-half teaspoonful; of the concentrated principle,
Eupatorin (<i>Purpu</i>), one-half to two grains.</p>

<p><b>Buchu</b> (<i>Barosma Crenata</i>). The leaves are used. This agent
has been extensively employed, generally in compounds. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of
infusion, (steeped for two hours or more) one to two ounces; of fluid
extract, the same; of the concentrated principle, Barosmin, one to three
grains.</p>

<p><b>Pipsissewa</b> (<i>Chimaphila Umbellata</i>), or Prince's Pine. This
is a tonic to the kidneys, as well as a diuretic and alterative, and is a
mild, but very efficient remedy. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of decoction, one ounce from
four to six times a day; of fluid extract, one-fourth to one-half
teaspoonful; of the concentrated principle, Chimaphilin, one to two
grains.</p>

<p><b>Water-melon Seeds</b> (<i>Cucurbita Citrullus</i>). <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of
infusion, the patient may drink freely until the desired effect is
secured.</p>

<p><b>Pumpkin Seeds</b> (<i>Cucurbita Pepo</i>). They are mild,
unirritating, yet effective diuretics. An infusion of these may be drunk
freely.</p>

<p><b>Sweet Spirit of Nitre</b> (<i>Spiritus &AElig;theris Nitros</i>), is
diuretic and anodyne. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;One-fourth to one-half teaspoonful,
diluted in water, every two or three hours.</p>

<p><b>Saltpetre</b> (<i>Potass&aelig; Nitras</i>). <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Powdered, five
to ten grains.</p>

<p><b>Acetate Of Potash</b> (<i>Potass&aelig; Acetas</i>). <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Ten to
fifteen grains, largely diluted in water. It is more frequently used for
this purpose than the nitrate. It is a most valuable diuretic.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>[pg
339]</span><h4>EMETICS.</h4>


<p>These are medicines which cause vomiting and evacuation of the stomach.
Some of the agents of this class, termed irritant emetics, produce vomiting
by a local action on the stomach, and do not affect this organ when
introduced elsewhere. Others, which may be termed systemic emetics, produce
their effects through the nervous system, and, therefore, must be absorbed
into the circulation before they can produce vomiting. In cases of
poisoning, it is desirable to empty the stomach as quickly as possible,
hence irritant emetics should be employed, for they act more speedily.
Draughts of warm water favor the action of emetics.</p>

<p><b>Mustard</b> (<i>Sinapis</i>) acts promptly and efficiently as an
emetic, and may be employed in poisoning. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;From one to two
teaspoonfuls of powdered mustard, stirred up in a glass of tepid water. It
should be quickly swallowed and diluents freely administered.</p>

<p><b>Sulphate Of Copper</b> (<i>Cupri Sulphas</i>) is a prompt, irritant
emetic. It should be given in doses of ten grains dissolved in half a glass
of water, and its action assisted by the free use of diluents.</p>

<p><b>Sulphate Of Zinc</b> (<i>Zinci Sulphas</i>) is similar in its effects
to sulphate of copper, but less powerful, and may be taken in the same
manner, and the dose repeated if necessary in fifteen minutes.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Subsulphate of Mercury</b> (<i>Hydrargyri Sulphas flava</i>),
commonly known as <i>Turpeth Mineral,</i> is an efficient and most
desirable emetic in membranous croup. It is an active poison, but, as it is
quickly thrown up with the contents of the stomach, there is no danger from
its administration. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;It should be given to a child in doses of
from three to five grains, in the form of powder, rubbed up with sugar of
milk.</p>

<p><b>Ipecac</b> (<i>Cephælis Ipecacuanha).</i>In large doses Ipecac is a
systemic emetic. In small doses, it exerts a specific influence upon the
mucous membranes, relieves nausea and irritation, and subdues inflammation.
In cholera infantum it is an invaluable remedy, if given in very small
doses. By allaying irritation of the stomach and restoring tone and
functional activity to it and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340"
id="Page_340"></a>[pg 340]</span>the bowels, it gradually checks the
discharges and brings about a healthy condition. It is also valuable in
dysentery, and is borne in large doses. As an emetic the dose is, of
powder, five to ten grains in warm water; of fluid extract, ten to twenty
drops.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise114"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:

Lobelia. </p>

<p><b>Lobelia</b> (<i>Lobelia Inflata</i>), sometimes known as Indian
Tobacco, or Emetic-weed. The herb and seeds are used. This is a powerful,
systemic emetic, but very depressing. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>[pg 341]</span>the
powdered leaves, fifteen to twenty grains; of the infusion, one to three
ounces; of the fluid extract, ten to fifteen drops.</p>

<p><b>Boneset</b> (<i>Eupatorium Perfoliatum).</i> <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the warm
infusion or decoction, two to three ounces; of the fluid extract, one
teaspoonful in hot water: of the concentrated principle, Eupatorin, two to
five grains.</p>


<h4>EMMENAGOGUES.</h4>


<p>Emmenagogue is a term applied to a class of medicines which have the
power of favoring the discharge of the menses. We shall mention only a few
of those which are best adapted to domestic use.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise115"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 133. Pennyroyal. " src="images/advise115.png" /></a><br />Fig. 133.
Pennyroyal. </p>

<p><b>Pennyroyal</b> (<i>Hedeoma Pulegioides).</i> Pennyroyal, used freely
in the form of a warm infusion, promotes perspiration and excites the
menstrual discharge when recently checked. A large draught of the infusion
should be taken at bed-time. The feet should be bathed in warm water
previous to taking the infusion.</p>

<p><b>Black Cohosh</b> (<i>Cimicifuga Racemosa).</i> Black Cohosh, known
also as Black Snake-root, is an effective remedy in uterine difficulties.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the tincture, twenty drops; of the fluid extract, ten
drops.</p>

<p><b>Tansy</b> (<i>Tanacetum Vulgare).</i> Tansy is beneficial in
suppressed menstruation. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the infusion, from one to four
fluid ounces.</p>

<p><b>Ergot</b> (<i>Secede Cornutum</i>) in very small doses acts as an
emmenagogue, and in large doses it checks hemorrhage. The dose as an
emmenagogue, of the fluid extract, is from two to five drops, and to arrest
hemorrhage, from half a drachm to two drachms, repeated in from one to
three hours.</p>

<p><b>Life-root</b> (<i>Senecio Gracilis.</i>) Life-root exerts a peculiar
influence upon the female reproductive organs, and for this reason has
received the name of Female Regulator It is very <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>[pg 342]</span>efficacious in promoting
the menstrual flow, and is a valuable agent in the treatment of uterine
diseases. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the decoction, four fluid ounces three or four
times a day; of the fluid extract, from one-fourth to one-half
teaspoonful.</p>

<p><b>Motherwort</b> (<i>Leonurus Cardiaca</i>). Motherwort is usually
given in warm infusion, in suppression of the menses from cold.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the decoction, from two to three fluid ounces every one or
two hours.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription</b> is an efficient remedy in
cases requiring a medicine to regulate the menstrual function. Full
directions accompany every bottle.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-weed</b> is an excellent
emmenagogue. Dr. Eberle, a very celebrated medical writer, and author of a
work on medicine which is very popular with the profession, says that he
has used the "Extract of Smart-weed" in twenty cases of amenorrhea
(suppressed menstruation), and affirms "with no other remedy or mode of
treatment have I been so successful as with this." Full directions
accompany every bottle. It is sold by all druggists.</p>


<h4>EXPECTORANTS.</h4>


<p>Expectorants are medicines which modify the character of the secretions
of the bronchial tubes, and promote their discharge. Most of the agents of
this class are depressing in their influence and thus interfere with
digestion and healthy nutrition. Their application is very limited, hence
we shall dismiss them without further consideration.</p>


<h4>LINIMENTS.</h4>


<p>Liniments are medicines designed for external application. The benefits
arising from their use depend upon their derivative power, as well as upon
the anodyne properties which many of them possess, rendering them
efficacious for soothing pain. We cannot mention a more valuable agent of
this class than</p>

<p><b>Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-weed.</b> As an external
application this preparation subdues inflammation and relieves pain. For
all wounds, bruises, sprains, bee-stings, insect and snake-bites,
frost-bites, chilblains, caked breast, swollen glands, rheumatism, and, in
short, for any and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343"
id="Page_343"></a>[pg 343]</span>all ailments, whether afflicting man or
beast, requiring a direct external application, either to allay
inflammation or soothe pain, the Extract of Smart-weed cannot be
excelled.</p>


<h4>NARCOTICS.</h4>


<p>A narcotic is a remedy which, in <i>medicinal</i> doses, allays morbid
sensibility, relieves pain, and produces sleep; but which, in overdoses,
produces coma, convulsions, and death. The quantity necessary to produce
these results varies in different individuals. We shall mention a few of
those most frequently employed.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise116"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 134. Henbane." src="images/advise116.png" /></a><br />Fig. 134.
Henbane.</p>

<p><b>Henbane</b> (<i>Hyoscyamus Niger</i>). The leaves and seeds are used.
Henbane, in large doses, is a powerful narcotic and dangerously poisonous.
In medicinal doses, it is anodyne and antispasmodic; it allays pain,
induces sleep, and arrests spasms. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344"
id="Page_344"></a>[pg 344]</span><i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the fluid extract, five to
ten drops; of the solid extract, from one-half to one grain; of the
concentrated principle, Hyoscyamin, from one-twelfth to one-fourth of a
grain.</p>

<p><b>Indian Hemp</b> (<i>Cannabis Indica</i>). An East Indian plant.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the extract, from one-fourth to one-half grain, of the
tincture, from three to eight drops; of the fluid extract, from two to five
drops. The plant known as Indian Hemp, growing in this country, possesses
very different qualities.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise117"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 135. Stramonium. " src="images/advise117.png" /></a><br />Fig. 135.
Stramonium. </p>

<p><b>Stramonium</b> (<i>Datura Stramonium</i>). Stramonium, also known as
Thorn-apple, in large doses is a powerful narcotic poison. In medicinal
doses it acts as an anodyne and antispasmodic. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of extract
of the leaves, from one-half to one grain; of
the fluid extract, from three to six drops.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>[pg
345]</span><h4>NERVINES.</h4>


<p>These are medicines which act on the nervous system, soothing excitement
and quieting the condition known as "nervousness."</p>

<p><b>Hops</b> (<i>Humulus Lupulus</i>). <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of infusion, one to
three ounces; of the fluid extract, one-fourth to one-half teaspoonful of
the concentrated principle, Humulin, two to three grains.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise118"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 136. Scull-cap. " src="images/advise118.png" /></a><br />Fig. 136.
Scull-cap. </p>

<p><b>Scull-cap.</b> (<i>Scutellaria Lateriolia</i>). The herb is used. It
is also known as Mad-dog Weed. This is a valuable remedy. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of
infusion, one to two ounces, of the fluid extract, ten to twenty drops; of
the concentrated principle, <i>Scutellarin</i>, one to two grains.</p>

<p><b>Lady's Slipper</b> (<i>Cypripedium Pubescens</i>). The root is <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>[pg 346]</span>used.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the infusion, one-half to one-ounce; of <b>the</b> fluid
extract, one-fourth to one-half teaspoonful; of the concentrated principle,
Cypripedin, one to two grains.</p>

<p><b>Pulsatilla</b> (<i>Pulsatilla Nigricans).</i> We employ the German
tincture, prepared from the green herb. In many of the distressing nervous
complications to which both males and females are subject in certain
diseases of the generative organs, we have found it very effectual. The
dose is from two to eight drops.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription.</b> This is a tonic nervine of
unsurpassed efficacy, combined in such a manner, that, while it quiets
nervous irritation, it strengthens the enfeebled nervous system, restoring
it to healthful vigor. In all diseases involving the female reproductive
organs, with which there is usually associated an irritable condition of
the nervous system, it is unsurpassed as a remedy. It is also a uterine and
general tonic of great excellence. It is sold by all druggists.</p>


<h4>SEDATIVES.</h4>


<p>Sedatives are a class of agents which control excitation of the
circulation, and diminish irritability of the nervous system.</p>

<p><b>Aconite</b> (<i>Aconitum Napellus</i>), The parts used are the root
and leaves. Aconite slows the pulse, diminishes arterial tension, and
lowers the temperature of the body in fevers. It is an effectual remedy in
acute inflammation of the tonsils and throat, in acute bronchitis, in
inflammation of the lungs, and pleurisy, in the hot stage of intermittent
and remittent fevers, in the eruptive fevers, in fever arising from a cold,
and in some forms of neuralgia. Acute suppression of the menses from a
cold, may be relieved by the tincture of aconite in drop doses every hour.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the tincture of the root, from one-half of a drop to two
drops, in a spoonful of water, in acute fevers and inflammations, from
one-half drop to one drop should be administered every half hour or hour,
according to the severity of the symptoms.</p>

<p><b>Peach Tree</b> (<i>Amygdalus Persica</i>). Peach tree leaves and bark
are slightly sedative, but the chief use which we have found for these
articles is to control nausea and vomiting arising from irritability of the
stomach. It also possesses mild, tonic properties. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of infusion
at the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>[pg
347]</span>bark of the small twigs or of the leaves, from two to six
teaspoonfuls.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise119"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 137. American Hellebore. " src="images/advise119.png" /></a><br />Fig.
137. American Hellebore. </p>

<p><b>American Hellebore</b> (<i>Veratrum Viride</i>) is also known as
White Hellebore, Indian Poke, or Swamp Hellebore. The root is the part
used. It is a most valuable agent with which to <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>[pg 348]</span>control the frequent,
strong, bounding pulse common to many febrile and inflammatory diseases.
When the pulse is hard, incompressible, and bounding, this remedy is more
effectual than aconite. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the tincture and fluid extract,
from one to two drops, repeated every half hour to two hours, according to
the severity of the symptoms. This remedy should be given in very small
doses, frequently repeated, if we would secure its best effects. Our
favorite mode of administering both veratrum and aconite is to add ten
drops of the tincture to ten or fifteen teaspoonfuls of water, of which one
teaspoonful may be administered every hour.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Jessamine</b> (<i>Gelseminum Sempervirens</i>). The root is
the part used. Through its controlling effect over the sympathetic nervous
system, this agent exerts a marked influence in controlling morbid
excitability of the circulatory organs. It allays irritation, and
determination of blood to the brain, indicated by flushed face, contracted
pupils, irritability, and restlessness, a frequent condition in diseases
incident to childhood. Its concentrated principle, Gelsemin, is an
efficient remedy in bloody-flux or dysentery. It should be administered in
very small doses to secure the best results. Only one-sixteenth to
one-eighth of a grain is required, repeated every two hours. It should be
triturated with sugar of milk or with common white sugar, in the proportion
of one grain to ten of sugar. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of tincture, from five to
fifteen drops; of fluid extract, three to six drops; of Gelsemin, as a
sedative, one-fourth to one-half grain.</p>


<h4>STIMULANTS.</h4>


<p>Stimulants are medicines which have the power of increasing the vital
activity of the body. Some have a very transient action, while others are
more permanent in effect.</p>

<p><b>Cayenne Pepper</b> (<i>Capsicum Annuum</i>). Cayenne Pepper is a
powerful stimulant. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the powder, from one to six grains,
administered in milk; of the tincture, from five to ten drops, largely
diluted in milk or water.</p>

<p><b>Black Pepper</b> (<i>Piper Nigrum</i>). Black Pepper is a warm,
carminative stimulant. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;From five to fifteen grains; of the
fluid extract, from ten to fifteen drops.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a>[pg 349]</span>


<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise120"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 138. Prickly-ash. " src="images/advise120.png" /></a><br />Fig. 138.
Prickly-ash. </p>

<p><b>Prickly-ash</b> (<i>Xanthoxylum Fraxineum).</i> Prickly-ash bark is a
stimulant and tonic. The parts used are the bark and leaves.
<i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the fluid extract, from five to fifteen drops; of the
tincture, ten to twenty drops; of the active principle, Xanthoxylin, one to
two grains.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol</b> is a powerful stimulant. It is never used in its pure
state in medicine, but when diluted forms a useful remedy in many diseases.
It is generally employed in the form of whiskey, gin, rum, brandy, and
wine.</p>

<p><b>Ammonia</b> is an excellent stimulant. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the carbonate,
from three to five grains; of the sesquicarbonate, from five to ten grains;
this is the same as the carbonate, which has been exposed to the air and
slacked (powdered hartshorn); of the aromatic spirit, from one-half to one
teaspoonful. The Aqua Ammonia and Liquor Ammonia are of such variable
strength that they are seldom employed internally, but may be applied
externally and taken by inhalation.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-Weed.</b> This quickly
diffusible stimulant and genial anodyne we have spoken of under the head of
Anodynes. But its medicinal properties equally entitle it to a place and
mention under the class of stimulants. As a stimulant it spurs the nervous
system and arouses the circulatory forces. Congestion of the lungs, liver,
bowels, or uterus, embarrasses the functions <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a>[pg 350]</span>of these organs.
Frequently this congestive difficulty may be entirely obviated, and the
circulation of the blood restored to the surface of the body, by the
administration of a few doses of this pleasant remedy. Thus it often acts
like magic in giving relief, promoting the circulation, and restoring the
organs to their accustomed functional activity. Full directions accompany
every bottle.</p>


<h4>TONICS.</h4>


<p>Tonics are remedies which moderately exalt the energies of all parts of
the body, without causing any deviation of healthy function. While
stimulants are transient in their influence, tonics are comparatively
permanent.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise121"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 139. White Poplar. " src="images/advise121.png" /></a><br />Fig. 139.
White Poplar. </p>

<p><b>White Poplar</b> (<i>Liriodendron Tulipfera</i>), called also
American Poplar, or White Wood. The part used is the inner bark. This is a
mild but valuable tonic for domestic use. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the infusion,
from one-half to one ounce; of tincture, from one to two teaspoonfuls.</p>

<p><b>Chamomile</b> (<i>Anthemis Nobilis</i>). The part used is the
flowers. This is a mild, unirritating tonic. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of infusion
(one-fourth ounce of flowers to a pint of water) one-half to one ounce.</p>

<p><b>Gentian</b> (<i>Gentiana Lutead</i>). The root is the part used. This
is a favorite domestic tonic in many localities. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of powdered
root, five to ten grains; of the tincture, ten to twenty drops; of the
fluid extract, five to ten drops, four or five times a day.</p>

<p><b>Nux Vomica</b> (<i>Strychnos Nux Vomica</i>), or Dog Button. This is
a powerful tonic. It increases innervation and is particularly valuable in
cases marked by feeble circulation and general impairment of muscular
power. In overdoses it is poisonous, and hence must be employed with much
caution. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the tincture, three to five drops; of the fluid
extract, <b>one to three drops.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a>[pg

Dogwood.</p>

<p><b>Dogwood</b> (<i>Cornus Florida</i>). Dogwood, also known Boxwood, is
tonic, astringent, and slightly stimulant. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the solid
extract, from three to five grains; of the infusion, from one to two
ounces; of the fluid extract, from ten to twenty drops.</p>

<p><b>Wafer-ash</b> (<i>Ptelea Trifoliata</i>), also called Swamp Dogwood.
The bark is used. This is a pure, unirritating tonic. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of
tincture, one-half to one teaspoonful; of fluid extract ten to twenty
drops; of the infusion, one to two fluid ounces.</p>

Golden Seal. </p>

<p><b>Golden Seal</b> (<i>Hydrastis Canadensis</i>). Golden Seal is a
powerful and most valuable tonic. It is a valuable local remedy when used
as a general injection in leucorrhea. <i>Dose</i>&mdash;Of the powder, from ten
to thirty grains; of the tincture, from one-half to one fluid drachm; of
the fluid extract, from ten to twenty drops; of the concentrated principle,

upon the digestive and nutritive functions, the Golden Medical Discovery
acts upon the excretory glands. Besides, it tends to retard unusual waste
and expenditure. This latter remedy tones, sustains, and, at the same time
regulates the functions. While increasing the discharge of noxious elements
accumulated in the system, it promptly arrests the wastes arising from
debility, and the unusual breaking down of the cells incident to quick
decline. It stimulates the liver to secrete, changes the sallow complexion,
and transforms the listless invalid into a vigorous and healthy being. At
the same time, it checks the rapid disorganization of the tissues and their
putrescent change, while it sustains the vital processes. It is, therefore,
and indispensable remedy in the treatment of many diseases.</p>

<h1>BATHS AND MOTION AS REMEDIAL AGENTS.</h1>


<p>The remedial effects of bathing are generally underrated. This want of
appreciation is more often due to the improper manner in which it is
performed than to an insufficiency of curative virtues. The term
<i>bathing</i> not only implies a cleaning of the body or certain portions
of it, but also the application of water in such a manner as to influence
the nervous system, and regulate the functions of the secretory organs.
Cleanliness, while it preserves health and promotes recovery, has reference
only to the hygienic influences of water and not to its curative effects.
There are several kinds of baths, the names of which indicate their
character, manner of application, or the part of the body to which they are
applied. Among others, we have Cold, Cool, Temperate, Tepid, Warm, Hot, Hot
Air, Russian, Turkish, Vapor, Electric, Sea, Shower, Sponge, Douche, Foot,
Sitz, Head, Medicated, Alkaline, Acid, Iodine, and Sulphur Baths.
Temperature influences the properties of any bath; thus the sponge, sitz,
and alkaline baths may be employed warm or cold, according to the effect
desired.</p>

<p><b>The Cold Bath</b>, used at a temperature of from 40&deg; to 60&deg;
Fahr., is powerfully sedative, and is employed for its tonic effects. If
the vital powers are low, or the individual remains in it too long (two or
three minutes should be the limit), the reaction is slow and its effects
injurious. While it is highly invigorating to robust persons, those who
have a low standard of vitality should be cautions in its employment. A
local bath <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a>[pg
357]</span>may be followed by beneficial results, when a general bath would
be inadmissible. For these reasons we advise the general use of the</p>

<p><b>Cool Bath</b>, at a temperature of from 60&deg; to 75&deg; Fahr. If,
in any instance, the <i>reaction</i> is <i>slow</i>, we recommend the</p>

<p><b>Temperate Bath</b>, at a temperature of from 75&deg; to 80&deg; Fahr.
The time of remaining in the bath should be regulated by the strength of
the invalid. As a rule, it should not exceed three <i>minutes</i>, and the
colder the water the less time should the patient be immersed. Immediately
after emerging from any bath, the body should be thoroughly dried and
rubbed with a moderately coarse towel until a glow is experienced and
reaction is fully established. The attempt to toughen children by exposing
them to low temperatures of either air or water, cannot be too emphatically
condemned. This caution, however, does not apply to the employment of
moderately cool water for ablutions. The cold or cool bath should be taken
in the early part of the day, but <i>never during digestion</i>. Whenever
reaction does not follow bathing, artificial means must be resorted to, as
stimulating drinks, dry warmth, or exercise.</p>

<p><b>The Tepid Bath</b>, the temperature of which is from 85&deg; to
92&deg; Fahr., is generally used for cleansing the body. It is prescribed
in fevers and inflammatory affections for its cooling effects. It is
usually medicated with some acid or alkali. The latter unites with the oily
secretion of the skin and forms a soapy compound easily removed by the
water. The temperature should be regulated according to the vitality of the
patient; and the bath may be repeated two or three times a day. It removes
superfluous heat, and keeps the skin in a condition favorable for
excretion.</p>

<p><b>The Warm Bath</b>, at a temperature varying from 92&deg; to 98&deg;
Fahr., is always agreeable and refreshing. It equalizes the circulation and
softens the skin, by removing all impurities. It moderates pain and soothes
the whole system. It does not weaken or debilitate the person, but is in
every way beneficial. It is an efficient, remedial agent in many chronic
diseases, convulsions, spasmodic affections of the bowels, rupture,
rheumatism, and derangement of the urino-genital organs. It should be
employed immediately before going to bed unless <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a>[pg 358]</span>urgent symptoms demand it
at other times. It may be medicated or not, as circumstances require, but
should always be taken in a warm room.</p>

<p><b>The Hot Bath</b> at a temperature of from 98&deg; to 110&deg; Fahr.
is a powerful stimulant. It excites the nerves, and through them the entire
system. It causes a sense of heat and a constriction of the secretory
organs; but perspiration, languor, and torpor soon follow. In the sudden
retrocession of cutaneous diseases, it restores the eruptions to the
surface and gives speedy relief. The hot bath may be applied locally when
circumstances require.</p>

<p><b>The Russian Bath</b> consists in the application of hot vapor, at a
temperature varying from 112&deg; to 200&deg; Fahr. The patient is first
subjected to a moderately warm temperature, which is gradually increased as
he becomes inured to it, the head being surrounded with cloths wet in cold
water. Upon emerging from it, the bather is plunged into cold water or
receives a cool, shower bath. In rheumatic and cutaneous diseases, chronic
inflammations, and nervous affections, the Russian bath is an effective
remedy.</p>

<p><b>The Turkish Bath</b> is a, dry, hot-air bath. The bather passes from
one apartment to another, each one being of a higher temperature than the
preceding. He undergoes a thorough shampooing, and, although the person may
be scrupulously clean, he will be astonished at the amount of effete matter
removed by this process. The bather then returns through the various
apartments, and, upon emerging from that of the lowest temperature, he
experiences a delightful sensation of vigor and elasticity.</p>

<p>As a hygienic agent, the hot-air bath has been' constantly growing in
favor. Its value is now recognized by all physicians throughout the world.
The judicious use of the Turkish bath serves to secure perfect equalization
of the circulation. Glandular activity is increased, elasticity and power
given to the muscles, and a permanent, stimulating and tonic influence
imparted to the system, a condition at once conducive to the enjoyment and
prolongation of life. Dr. Erasmus Wilson, of England, says, in a paper read
before the London Medical Association: "The inhabitant of a large city
would live as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359"
id="Page_359"></a>[pg 359]</span>healthy, immured within city walls, as
amid the fields and meadows of the country. His bath would be to him in the
place of a country house or horse&mdash;it would give him air, exercise,
freshness, health, and life."</p>

<p>"The bath that cleanses the inward as well as the outward man; that is
applicable to every age; that is adapted to make health healthier, and
alleviate disease, whatever its stage or severity, deserves to be adopted
as a national institution, and merits the advocacy of all medical men; of
those whose especial duty it is to teach how health may be preserved, and
how disease may be averted."</p>

<p>The hot, <i>dry</i> atmosphere of the Turkish bath promotes rapid
evaporation from the surface of the body, and it is well known that rapid
evaporation from the surface is a cooling process. A person's finger may be
frozen in one minute's time, by throwing upon it a constant, fine spray of
rhigolene or sulphuric ether. The rapid evaporation of the light fluid
congeals the liquids of the tissues and a film of ice is rapidly formed
upon the part. In a less intense degree the same cooling process is carried
on over the whole surface of a person, when in the hot room, or
<i>sudatorium</i>, of the Turkish bath. The evaporation from the surface is
so rapid that one can hardly appreciate the profuseness of the perspiration
going on. The evaporation from the surface so rapidly carries off the heat
from the body that one finds himself able, with little or no inconvenience,
to remain in a room heated to from 180&deg; to 200&deg; or even 220&deg;
Fahr.</p>

<p>As a hygienic measure to be regularly or occasionally employed by
persons in fair health, the Turkish or hot dry-air bath is far superior to
the Russian or vapor-bath. (1.) It produces more profuse perspiration, and
is therefore more depurating, or cleansing, in its effects. (2.) It does
not relax the system, but rather produces a tonic effect, and fewer
precautions are, therefore, necessary to guard against taking cold after
employing it. (3.) The Turkish bath can be better ventilated than the
Russian. While the air is heated to a high temperature, it can be readily
kept pure by constant changes. In the Turkish hot-rooms, or
<i>sudatorium</i>, of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, provision
is made for bringing underneath the floors a current of fresh air from
without. This column of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360"
id="Page_360"></a>[pg 360]</span>fresh air is carried under the centre of
each room where it escapes from the conductor, is warmed, and rises into
the room, from which extraction of air is constantly going on through
registers opening into tubes, communicating with large ventilated shafts
which are kept hot, summer and winter, to insure a draught through them. In
this manner, thorough ventilation of our Turkish hot-rooms is insured.</p>

<p>The Turkish bath not only combines a most agreeable luxury with a
decidedly invigorating and tonic influence, but also, by its stimulating
power, induces proper glandular and cellular activity, producing a healthy
condition.</p>

<p>Sallowness, tan, and freckles, the result of local or general increase
of the pigment granules of the skin, soon disappear under the stimulating
influence and regular use of the Turkish bath, which causes rapid
development of new and transparent cells. The colored granules are thus
gradually replaced and the skin assumes a beautiful clearness and purity of
appearance, which transcends immeasurably the unhealthy hue that follows
the frequent employment of the various cosmetics.</p>

<p>The value of an agent which thus improves the general health, insures
immunity from coughs, colds, and other diseases, and at the same time
produces a healthy and permanent beauty of complexion, is at once apparent.
The purity of person, perfect circulation, increase of healthy nutrition
and glandular activity produced by the Turkish bath, serve to make it of
the most lasting utility.</p>

<p>The eminent Dr. Madden has said, and his experience is confirmed by
every regular patron of the bath, that, "Wherever the Turkish bath was a
national institution the hair of the women was peculiarly luxurious and
beautiful. I can vouch for it that the use of the bath rendered the
complexion more delicate and brilliant; that the eyes became clearer and
brighter; all the personal charms were enhanced. I can recommend no
hygienic measure more beneficial or effectual in preserving the health and
an attractive personal appearance."</p>

<p>Pimples, blotches, eruptions, and other disfigurations of the skin are
removed by the frequent use of the Turkish bath, leaving the integument
smooth and soft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a>[pg
361]</span><b>How the Turkish Bath is Administered at the Invalid's Hotel
and Surgical Institute</b>. The hot-rooms, of which there are two, are
exactly similar in every respect except as regards temperature. The first
room has a temperature of from 110&deg; to 120&deg; Fahr. The bather is
supplied by the attendant every few minutes with copious draughts of cool
water. Gradually the relaxing influence of the elevated temperature
manifests itself. The capillaries slowly dilate, the veins enlarge under
its gentle stimulus, and small points of perspiration appear upon the
surface, which assumes a slight, rosy blush. A delightful calm, a feeling
of perfect rest and luxurious ease is imparted to the senses. From this
room, after an appropriate interval, the bather enters the second room, in
which the atmosphere is higher by from 20&deg; to 30&deg;, and it may be
made still higher, its regulation requiring but an instant.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise127"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 145. One of the Shampooing rooms." src="images/advise127.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 145. One of the Shampooing rooms.</p>

<p>A thorough sweating occurs while the subject remains in these rooms,
during a period of from ten to forty minutes. The secretions of the skin,
at first impure and loaded with the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of dead cells and
extraneous matter, gradually become purer, and clearer, until, finally, all
trace of color disappears and the pearly drops of sweat come full and free.
Soon the attendant appears and leads the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a>[pg 362]</span>way to the
shampooing-room, where, lying upon a warm marble slab, <i>massage</i> is
applied most thoroughly to every portion of the body.</p>

<p>By the <i>massage</i>, shampooing, or rubbing, the superficial veins are
thoroughly emptied of their contents, the muscles are given elasticity and
tone, and glandular activity is promoted. Innumerable dead epithelial
cells, together with other impurities, are rolled off in flakes under the
skillful manipulation of the attendant.</p>

<p>After a thorough shampooing, the shower bath is applied, to secure a
contraction of the capillaries and a diminution of the perspiration.</p>

<p><b>The Spirit Vapor-bath</b> is very effective when employed in the
earlier stages of acute, febrile, inflammatory, and painful diseases. In
many forms of chronic diseases the administration of a spirit vapor-bath
once in from three to fifteen days, is a valuable adjunct to the treatment
of these affections. It exerts an exceedingly beneficial influence upon the
entire system, and, when habitually employed, may ward off disease.</p>

<p>The body should be moistened with an alkaline solution before the
administration of a spirit vapor-bath. After the perspiration which it
occasions has subsided, which will usually be in from three to four hours,
sponge the body with a mixture of the following ingredients: water, three
gills; alcohol, one gill; salt, one teaspoonful. By this method the patient
experiences none of the unpleasant effects which generally follow the
employment of diaphoretics. Various kinds of apparatus have been devised to
facilitate the application of the spirit vapor-baths. Most of them are
cumbersome and expensive, and, consequently, are seldom used except in
hospitals or sanitariums.</p>

<p>The following method described by Dr. J. King, may be advantageously
employed.</p>

<p>"The patient is undressed, ready for getting into bed, having removed
the clothing worn through the day and put on a night shirt or other
clothing to be worn while sweating, and during the night, if the bath is
taken at bed-time. He is then seated on a high Windsor or wooden-bottomed
chair, or instead thereof, a bench or board may be placed on a common
open-bottomed chair, care being taken that the bottom is so covered <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a>[pg 363]</span>that
the flame will not burn him. After seating himself, a large coverlet or
blanket is thrown around him from behind, covering the back of his head and
body, as well as the chair, and another must be passed around him in front,
which last is to be pinned at the neck, loosely, so that he can raise it
and cover his face, or remove it down from the face from time to time as
occasion demands during the operation of the bath. The blankets must reach
down to the floor, and cover each other at the side, so as to retain the
vapor. This having been done, a saucer or tin vessel, into which is put one
or two tablespoonfuls of whiskey, brandy, alcohol, or any liquor that will
burn, is then placed upon the floor, directly under the centre of the
bottom of the chair, raising a part of the blanket from behind to place it
there; then light a piece of paper, apply the flame to the liquor, and as
soon as it kindles let down the part of the blanket which has been raised,
and allow the liquor to burn until it is consumed, watching it from time to
time to see that the blankets are not burned. As soon as consumed, put more
liquor into the saucer, about as much as before, and again set it on fire,
being careful to put no liquor into the saucer while the flame exists, as
there would be danger of setting fire to the blanket, and producing injury
to the patient. Continue this until the patient perspires freely, which, in
a majority of cases, will be in five or ten minutes."</p>

<p>"If, during the operation the patient feels faint or thirsty, cold water
must be sprinkled or dashed in his face, or he may drink one or two
swallows of it,&mdash;and in some cases the head may be bathed with cold water.
As soon as free perspiration is produced, wrap the blankets around him,
place him in bed, and cover him up warm, giving him about a pint of either
some good store tea, ginger, or some diaphoretic herb tea to drink, as warm
as he can take it. After two or three hours, remove the covering, piece by
piece, at intervals of twenty or twenty-five minutes each, that he may
gradually cease perspiring."</p>

<p>The above method may be improved by using an ordinary hoop skirt, ten to
twelve inches below the bottom of which is suspended a larger and stronger
hoop. The upper and smaller hoops should rest upon the patient's shoulders.
A woolen blanket, large enough to reach and rest upon the floor, and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a>[pg 364]</span>envelop
the whole person, is thrown over the hoops. Unless the bath is employed to
diminish the quantity of fluids in the body (as in dropsy), the patient may
drink some simple, diaphoretic infusion, to hasten or facilitate
perspiration. When he perspires freely, small quantities of cold water may
be frequently given. "There is little or no danger of taking cold after
this process, if ordinary precaution is observed, and it is easy,
agreeable, safe, and effectual."</p>

<p>"Occasionally we will meet with patients, upon whom it is almost
impossible to produce the slightest moisture, much less perspiration. The
skin of such persons is generally dry and harsh, communicating an
unpleasant sensation to the touch. In most instances the skin may be
restored to its normal condition, by adopting the following course: 1st.
Anoint the whole surface of the body and limbs with olive oil every night
upon retiring to bed. 2nd. Every morning wash the whole surface with a
warm, weak, alkaline solution, employing considerable friction while
drying. 3rd. Every two weeks administer a spirit vapor-bath. A perseverance
in this course for a few months will accomplish the desired result."</p>

<p>Frequent reference to spirit vapor-baths will be made by the author of
this work, in speaking of those diseases in which its employment will prove
beneficial.</p>

<p><b>Sea Bathing</b> is an excellent, remedial agent in chronic disorders,
particularly in those of an atonic character, such as nervous prostration,
dyspepsia, and general debility.</p>

<p>Much of the benefit attributed to this mode of bathing is undoubtedly
due to other influences, such as pure air, exercise, change of scenery,
diet, and associations which surround the patient during his sojourn at the
sea-shore.</p>

<p>At first, the duration of a sea-bath should not exceed three or five
minutes, but it may be gradually prolonged to fifteen or twenty minutes. If
the patient is very feeble, one or two baths a week are sufficient, and the
most robust person should never take more than one a day. They should
always be taken in the earlier portion of the day, before breakfast if
possible, and <i>never during digestion</i>.</p>

<p>Before entering this bath, a moderate degree of exercise should always
be taken, enough to arouse the vital energies, but <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a>[pg 365]</span>not to produce fatigue.
Suitably dressed, the patient plunges into the water, in which he remains
during the prescribed time. Immediately after emerging from the bath, the
patient should be thoroughly dried and dressed and then moderate exercise
should be taken to induce reaction. If the reaction is slow, a mild
stimulant may be taken and the duration of the bath must be diminished the
next time. When sea-bathing is beneficial improvement is soon manifested.
The blood becomes richer, the whole system is strengthened and the
functions are performed with more regularity. To the rich, sea-bathing is a
luxury, but it is a remedy beyond the reach of the poorer classes unless
they live near the sea-shore.</p>

<p><b>The Shower Bath</b> produces a shock to the nervous system by
suddenly coming in contact with the skin. Numerous streams of cold water
fall upon the neck, shoulders, and body of the patient who stands beneath
the hose or reservoir. When the patient is plethoric, feeble, or nervous,
or when some internal organ is diseased, the cold, shower bath should
<i>not</i> be employed. In simple debility unaccompanied by inflammation or
symptoms of internal congestion, its use proves advantageous. By moderating
the force of the shower, and substituting tepid water, the most delicate
persons can endure it and profit thereby. The usual means for inducing a
good reaction, friction, and exercise, should be employed.</p>

<p><b>The Douche Bath</b> consists of a stream of water, dashed or thrown
upon the patient from a moderate height or distance, with considerable
force. The size, temperature, and force of the stream may be modified to
suit the exigencies of the case. It is locally employed as a remedy for
sprains, weak or stiff joints, old swellings, etc. The cold, douche bath is
more powerful than the shower bath and should be given with the same
precautions which govern the application of the latter.</p>

<p><b>The Sponge Bath</b> admits of extensive employment in both acute and
chronic diseases, and its simplicity renders it of untold value. It
consists in a general or local application of water (medicated or not) at
any desired temperature. The quantity may be great or small to suit the
requirements of the case. If it is applied in acute diseases at a
temperature agreeable to the patient, it is exceedingly grateful and may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a>[pg
366]</span>repeated as often as necessary. It may be rendered alkaline by
the addition of some compound of soda, in the proportion of a teaspoonful
to a quart of water. A portion of the body may be bathed at a time, and
quickly dried, thus avoiding any exposure to cold. It removes excessive
animal heat, relaxes the capillaries, equalizes the circulation, and
produces comfort, tranquility, and sleep.</p>

<p>Nothing is more conducive to the health and comfort of laboring men in
summer than a daily bath, and it is a matter of regret that there are so
few conveniences for the purpose in most homes, especially those in the
country. Farmers in particular need bathing facilities, and yet in most
cases they are almost entirely without them. For their benefit we will
describe a device which we can recommend to all who want a cheap,
convenient, and easily managed apparatus for sponge bathing in the
bed-room.</p>

<p>The articles required are a piece of rubber-cloth a yard and a quarter
square, four slats, two inches wide and three feet long, notched at the
ends so as to lock together in the form of a square, and a large sponge.
The slats are placed upon the floor and the rubber cloth is spread over
them (there is no need of fastening it to the slats), forming a shallow
square vessel a yard wide. In this the bather stands and applies the water
with a sponge from a basin or bowl on a stand placed conveniently near.
There need be no danger of wetting the carpet, or spoiling the
furniture.</p>

<p>When the bath is finished, gather three corners of the rubber cloth in
the left hand, take the fourth corner in the right in such a way as to form
a spout when lifted or held over the slop-jar or bucket. The water may be
poured out in a moment, when the cloth should be spread over the back of a
chair to dry, and the slats unlocked and set away in a closet.</p>

<p><b>The Foot Bath</b> is frequently employed, as a means of causing
diaphoresis, in colds, attacks of acute diseases, and also to draw the
blood from the head or some internal organ. It is a powerful auxiliary in
the treatment of those chronic diseases in which inflammation, congestion,
and a feeble circulation are prominent symptoms. The water should be as hot
as it can be borne and the temperature kept up by additions of hot water.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a>[pg
367]</span>It may be made stimulating by the addition of salt, mustard,
ginger, or cayenne pepper.</p>

<p><b>The Sitz Bath</b>. A tub is so arranged that the patient can sit down
in it while bathing. In this manner the lower part of the abdomen, hips,
and upper part of the thighs, are immersed in whatever fluid the bath is
composed of. It is applicable in diseases of the pelvic organs, and may be
hot, warm, cool, cold, or medicated, according to the effect desired.</p>

<p>The bath tub should be large enough to permit a thorough rubbing and
kneading of the diseased parts, and the patient may remain in it from ten
to thirty minutes. The clothing may be wholly or partially removed, as
agreeable to the individual. A <i>warm</i>, sitz bath is an effective,
remedial adjunct in menstrual suppression and in painful menstruation,
gravel, spasmodic and acute inflammatory affections generally. The
<i>cold</i>, sitz bath is used as a tonic in cases of relaxed tissues of
the pelvis, in debility of the urino-genital organs, in piles, prolapsus of
the rectum, and in constipation.</p>

<p><b>The Head Bath</b>. A shallow basin contains the fluid for the bath;
and the patient, assuming a recumbent position, immerses a portion of the
head, generally the back part. The temperature may be warm, cool, or cold,
as desired.</p>

<p><b>Medicated Baths</b> are infusions of vegetable or other substances in
water. They are sometimes applied with the sponge, though generally the
patient is immersed. The temperature at which they are usually employed is
that of the tepid bath. The nature and strength of the medication depends
upon the character of the disease for which it is employed.</p>

<p><b>The Alkaline Bath</b> is prepared by dissolving half a pound of
carbonate of soda in sixty gallons of water. It is useful in those diseases
in which the fluids of the body are abnormally acid, as in rheumatism.</p>

<p><b>The Acid Bath</b> is prepared by adding two pounds of muriatic or
hydrochloric acid to sixty gallons of water. A much smaller quantity of the
acid is sometimes used, and in some instances vinegar is substituted.</p>

<p><i>Scott's Acid Bath</i> is composed of nitro-muriatic acid (aqua regia)
and water. It should be prepared in a wooden tub, and a sufficient quantity
of acid used to give the water a sour taste. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a>[pg 368]</span>It is extensively used in
India as a remedy for disorders of the liver.</p>

<p><b>The Iodine Bath</b> is composed of the following ingredients:
tincture of iodine, two drachms; iodide of potassium, four drachms; water,
forty gallons. It should be prepared in a wooden tub. It reddens the skin.
For children, a much weaker solution must be employed. Its use is generally
restricted to scrofulous and tubercular affections.</p>

<p><b>The Sulphur Bath</b> is prepared by dissolving eight ounces of
sulphuret of potassium and two ounces of dilute sulphuric acid in sixty
gallons of water. The acid may be omitted.</p>

<p><b>A Sulphur Vapor-bath</b> is often employed in cities where the
necessary apparatus can be procured. It may be improvised by placing
sulphur on a shovel over hot coals. The patient should be prepared as in
the spirit vapor-bath, and burning sulphur substituted for the liquor. The
patient is then enveloped in the fumes of sulphurous oxide. Heating a
mixture of sulphur and sulphuric acid, produces the same result. If the gas
is inhaled in large quantities it causes irritation of the respiratory
passages, and suffocation. It is therefore necessary that the coverings
should be securely fastened at the neck, and that the room be one which can
be quickly filled with pure air This bath is used in cutaneous, rheumatic,
and syphilitic disorders.</p>

<p><b>Fomentations</b> consist of the general or local application of
woolen cloths wrung out of hot water. They should not be so light as to be
ineffectual, nor so heavy as to be burdensome. They should not be wet
enough to drip, nor applied so as to expose the body to the surrounding
air. A fresh cloth should be ready for application before the first one is
removed, and the change quickly effected. Fomentations are effectual in
relieving congestion and inflammation.</p>

<p><b>The Wet Sheet Pack</b>. As this remedial appliance will be frequently
recommended in the pages following, its mode of application is here
described. Take a pail half filled with cold water, gather together one end
of a common cotton sheet, and immerse it, allowing it to remain while
preparing the bed, which may be done as follows: remove all the bed-clothes
except a coverlet and the pillows, then spread upon it, in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a>[pg 369]</span>the
following order, two ordinary comforters, one woolen blanket, one woolen
sheet, (or two woolen sheets if a woolen blanket is not at hand); then
wring out one-half or two-thirds of the water from the wet sheet, spread it
smoothly upon the blanket, and the patient being undressed, places himself
on the sheet, with his arms extended, while an assistant wraps him closely
and tightly with it, as quickly as possible. Each arm may be thus covered
by the wet sheet, or may lie outside of it, and be covered by wet towels,
prepared in the same manner as the sheet. Then quickly and tightly cover
with the blankets and comforters, tucking snugly from head to foot. The
head should also be covered with a wet towel, and a bottle of warm water
placed to the feet, or near enough to keep them warm.</p>

<p>After the first shock of the chill is over, the pack is very pleasant
and refreshing, and the patient should go to sleep, if possible. The
ordinary time for a patient to remain in a pack is about sixty minutes.
Thirty or forty minutes is sufficient, if he is in a feeble condition.
Never wring the sheet out of warm water, for one of its principal benefits
comes from the vigorous reaction induced by its cold temperature. After
remaining in the pack from thirty to sixty minutes, allow the patient to
stand on his feet, if he is able, and have the whole surface of his body
bathed. Rub briskly, and dry with towels, or by throwing over the body a
dry sheet and then rubbing him. The dry sheet retains the bodily warmth and
is more comfortable, but interferes with the completeness and vigor of the
rubbing of the body. Be sure and establish full reaction, which may be
known by the warmth of the surface. Frequently, when the patient is
released from the pack, and is being bathed, rolls of scales, scurf, and
<i>skin-debris</i> come off, thus giving palpable evidence of the utility
of the pack in freeing the myriads of pores of the skin of effete matter.
It is efficient in fevers, and for breaking up colds, and is a very
valuable, remedial agent in most chronic diseases, assisting in removing
causes which depress the bodily functions.</p>


<h4>MOTION IS A REMEDIAL AGENT.</h4>


<p>The stability of the planetary system depends upon the converted motion
of its parts. So in the human system, motion <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a>[pg 370]</span>is a fundamental principle
which underlies every vital process. Health consists in normal, functional
activity. The human system is the arena of various kinds of motions, both
of fluids and of solids, and life and health depend upon these
physiological movements. There are the movements incident to
<i>respiration</i>, the expansion and contraction of the walls of the
chest, bringing the oxygen of the air into contact with the blood as it
circulates through the lungs. Corresponding with the movements of the chest
are the <i>motions of the abdominal walls</i>, which promote the functions
of the organs of the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p>There are <i>motions of the heart and arteries</i>, which urge the blood
out to the extremities and diffuse it through every part of the system, and
also <i>motion of the blood in the capillaries</i>, by which the blood is
circulated through the tissues, that the latter may be built up from its
nutritive constituents. Then there is the <i>motion of the vital
current</i> in the veins returning towards the heart, and urged forward by
the muscular and pump-like action of the chest and abdominal walls. The
peristaltic <i>motions of the stomach and bowels</i> urge onward digesting
materials, exposing them successively to different solvents and aiding the
absorption of nutritive matter. No less essential to life and health are
numerous other minute operations or <i>motions</i>, on which vital power in
all its manifestations of muscular and nervous energy depends. Many other
<i>motions</i> are consequent upon decay, growth, and repair. Oxygen,
carbonic acid, watery vapors, and other gaseous matter are constantly being
exchanged between the system and atmosphere. Then, the human system being a
complex, chemical laboratory, there are <i>motions consequent upon chemical
action</i>, constantly going on within it.</p>

<p><i>Muscular motion</i>, under the direction of the will, is also
absolutely necessary for the maintenance of good health.</p>

<p>Animal heat and muscular and nervous power are dependent upon motions of
the minutest particles composing the body. The body is composed of fluid
and semi-fluid matter, permitting great freedom of motion. Health requires
that there shall be <i>a constant change of place</i>, an active
transmission of material to and from vital organs and parts, through the
medium of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a>[pg
371]</span>blood-vessels, as well as outside such vessels; that is, motion
of interstitial fluids.</p>

<p><b>Nature's mode of Sustaining Health.</b> The act of transforming
latent, non-vital force which exists pent-up in food, as heat is in coal,
into vital energy, requires the simultaneous elimination from the system of
a like amount of worn-out matter. Assimilation of nutritive materials is
impossible, unless a like amount of matter be eliminated from the system.
Muscular and nervous energy are dependent upon activities which cause
waste. Not only is this true in a general way, but it is also true that the
energy produced by the operations of the vital system has a strict relation
to the wasting products&mdash;that <i>full</i> energy is only attained by
<i>perfected</i> waste. Use, waste, and power, then, sustain definite and
dependent or corresponding relations, since waste is as essential to health
as is supply.</p>

<p>Without waste, disturbance is at once produced in the system similar to
that resulting from the introduction of foreign matter. These disturbances
constitute disease. The more obvious effects of lack of waste and
elimination are mechanical. The circulation is loaded with effete and
useless matter, the vessels being thereby weakened and distended, and the
circulation retarded. The capillaries become clogged and vital action is
diminished. Local congestions, inflammations, effusions, morbid growths,
and other pathological results follow.</p>

<p>Deranged or suppressed action characterizes, and, indeed, constitutes
all departures from health which we call disease. Suffering indicates
action, but action which is perverted into wrong channels, or action in one
part at the expense of motion in other parts, constituting a disturbance in
the equilibrium of forces, from which the system suffers.</p>

<p><b>Value or Mechanical Movements and manipulations for the Treatment of
Chronic Diseases.</b> To correct and restore deranged movements, thereby
producing normal, functional activity of every organ and part of the
system, must therefore be the chief object of the physician. All remedies,
of whatever school or nature, imply motion, and depend for their efficacy
upon their ability to excite motion in some one or more elements, organs,
or parts of the system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a>[pg
372]</span>While we do not wish to detract from the real merits of medicine
as a curative agent, yet we must admit that the remedial power of motion,
transmitted either manually or mechanically, is founded upon rational and
physiological principles. All systems of medicine, however much they may
differ superficially, propose, as the chief end to be attained by the
administration of medicine, or by other treatment, that <i>motions</i>
identical with physiological activity should be incited or promoted. How
best to accomplish this result, and with least cost to vitality, is an
important consideration. Bearing in mind the conservation of forces, that
energy or power is as indestructible as matter, that it may be changed into
other forms but never lost, it is plain that mechanical force may be
applied to the living system and transformed into vital energy; that
chemical action, animal heat, and magnetism may represent in the system the
mechanical force transmitted to the body. Keeping in view the transformable
nature of force, and the need that our systems have of auxiliary power in
different departments, when normal activity is impaired by disease, we can
readily understand how undoubted, curative effects result from either the
manual or the mechanical administration of motion.</p>

<p><b>Rubbing</b> is a process universally employed by physicians of every
school for the relief of a great diversity of distressing symptoms, is
instinctively resorted to by sympathizers and attendants upon the sick, and
constitutes one of the chief duties of the nurse. Uncivilized people resort
to this process as their principal remedy in all forms of disease.</p>

<p>The difficulty in administering motion as a remedial agent by manual
effort, such as rubbing, kneading, oscillating, flexing, and extending the
limbs, lies in the impossibility of supplying the <i>amount, intensity</i>,
and <i>variety</i> of movement required to make it most effective. The
power of the arm and the strength of the operator are exhausted before the
desired effect is produced. Inventive genius has at last overcome the
obstacles to the successful and perfect administration of motion as a
curative agent. We have now a series of machines propelled by mechanical
power, by the use of which we rub, knead, manipulate, and apply in
succession a great variety of movements to all parts of the body. These
machines transmit motion to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373"
id="Page_373"></a>[pg 373]</span>the body from inexhaustible sources, never
tire, but are ever ready for new, remedial conquests. The movements
administered by their use, <i>while entirely under the control of the
patient</i>, are never disagreeable, and are far more rapid and intense
than can possibly be given by the hands. By the application of short, quick
movements of from <i>twelve to fifteen hundred vibrations a minute</i>,
deep-seated organs and parts are reached, to which motion is transmitted
and in which vital energy is thereby generated. The hands have not the
power, by kneading, manipulating, or rubbing to impress the system except
in a very mild degree, and deep-seated organs and parts are scarcely
influenced by the comparatively slow movements thus administered. Among the
most important, mechanical inventions devised for administering motion as a
remedial agent, is one which has received the name of the
<i>manipulator</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Manipulator</b>. With this machine motion can be applied to any
organ or part of the system, and intensity of the application regulated to
a nicety. The rapidity of motion necessary to produce active exhilaration
of any part of the body is easily secured by the use of the manipulator,
but is far beyond the power of the hands. The degree of circulation given
to the fluids, both inside and outside of the vessels, and of energy
imparted to the organs and parts operated upon by the manipulator, is also
unapproachable by the application of manual power.</p>

<p><b>Effects Upon the Circulation and Nutrition</b>. The influence of
motion on these functions is as follows: The contents of the blood-vessels
are moved onward by the pressure and motion transmitted by the manipulator,
all backward movement of the blood being prevented by the valves of the
veins and by the propelling power of the heart and arteries. Fluids outside
these vessels pass through their walls, to take the place of the stagnant
blood that has been moved onward. Other blood flows into the part, and thus
active and healthy circulation is induced, and nutritive material, capable
of affording vital support is also brought to refresh the local part.</p>

<p>We have found mechanical movements especially effectual in paralysis,
neuralgia, sleeplessness, and other nervous affections; in derangements of
the liver, constipation, and dyspepsia; in <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a>[pg 374]</span>displacements of the
uterus, and congestion, and inflammation of the pelvic organs.</p>

<p>For a complete description of the mechanical movements and the machinery
employed in the treatment of diseases at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute, the reader is referred to the appendix to this work.</p>

<h2><a name='IIICHAPTER_IV'></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h1>HYGIENIC TREATMENT OF THE SICK.</h1>


<p>There are two essentials requisite to the successful treatment of the
sick: (1.) Medical skill; (2.) Good nursing. The former is necessary in
order that the condition of the patient be fully understood, and the proper
means be employed to effect his recovery. The latter is essential, in order
that all influences favoring the production and development of disease may
be removed, the tendencies to restoration be promoted by every possible
means, and the directions of the physician be properly observed.</p>

<p>Success in the treatment of the sick requires good nursing. Without it,
the most skillful physicians fail to effect a cure; with it, the most
unqualified may succeed. If certain hygienic agencies are essential to the
maintenance of health, how much more necessary it is that they be employed
in sickness! If certain conditions cause disease, how great the necessity
is that such conditions be obviated and hygienic ones substituted!</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the importance of good nursing, in the rural districts
it is frequently difficult to find a professional nurse, or, if one can be
obtained, it is often impossible for the invalid to procure such services,
on account of the expense which must necessarily be incurred. Hence, this
office usually devolves upon some relative who is considered to be the best
qualified for the position; or, as is often the case, necessity demands
that the patient be left to a change of nurses. A woman is generally
selected for this important position. Her <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a>[pg 376]</span>soft hand and soothing
voice, her kindly, sympathetic, and provident nature, together with her
scrupulous cleanliness, render her man's equal, if not his superior, in the
capacity of nurse. There are circumstances, however, in which the services
of a man are indispensable; hence the necessity that all should be
qualified to care for the sick.</p>

<p>A nurse should be attentive to the requirements of physician and
patient, for she sustains an intimate relation to both. She should observe
the directions of the physician, and faithfully perform them. She should
note all the symptoms of the patient, and do everything in her power to
promote comfort and recovery. She should anticipate the wishes, and not
cause the patient to ask for everything which is desired. So far as
practicable, let the wishes be gratified. The senses of the sick often
become morbidly acute, and those things which in health would pass
unnoticed, in sickness are so magnified as to occasion annoyance and
vexation. Sick persons are not all alike, and the peculiarities of each
must be studied separately. The nurse must be <i>kind</i>, but <i>firm</i>,
and not yield to such whims of the patient as may be detrimental to
recovery; neither must she arouse dislike or anger by opposition, but
endeavor to <i>win</i> the patient from all delusions. The feelings of the
patient should never be trifled with, for idealities become realities.</p>

<p>The nurse should possess an inexhaustible store of patience. Disease
affects the mind of the patient and fills it with strange delusions. The
sick are often querulous, fretful, and unreasonable, and should be treated
with kindness, forbearance, and sympathy. The nurse should always be
cheerful, look on the bright side of every circumstance, animate them with
encouragement, and inspire them with hope. Hope is one of the best of
tonics. It stimulates the flagging, vital energies, and imparts new life to
the weak and exhausted forces. Gloom, sadness, and despondency depress the
vital forces and lead to death. We have seen patients rapidly sinking, who
had given up all hope, and were quietly awaiting the coming of death,
snatched, as it were, from its grasp, and restored to health, by words of
cheer and encouragement.</p>

<p>The nurse should possess <i>moral principles</i>, which alone can <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a>[pg 377]</span>win the
confidence of the patient. She should have judgment, circumspection,
intelligence, forethought, alacrity, carefulness, and neatness. In a word
she should exercise <i>common sense</i>.</p>

<p>We deem it but justice to say a word in behalf of the nurse. She, too,
is a human being, subject to disease, and, unless hygienic conditions be
observed, will soon be stricken low by its presence. She must be relieved
occasionally and get rest, or she cannot long withstand the combined
influence of fatigue and disease. Her office is an arduous one at best, and
the long, weary hours of night-watching should be compensated by exercise
in the open air, as well as by sleep during the day. Unless this be done,
the system will become exhausted, and sleep will intrude itself upon her at
the time when the greatest diligence is required for the welfare of the
patient, when the vital powers are at their lowest ebb. She should be
supplied with plenty of suitable food during the night, to sustain her and
to serve as a safeguard against the invasion of disease. She should be
treated with kindness and respect, else her disposition may become morose
and reflect itself upon the patient, causing peevishness and
despondency.</p>

<p><b>The Sick-room</b> should be as comfortable, cheerful, and pleasant,
as circumstances will allow. Let the room be large and airy, and furnished
with a stove, or better still, a fireplace. All articles of clothing and
furniture, not necessary to the comfort of the patient, should be removed
from the room, and in <i>malignant</i> or <i>contagious</i> diseases the
carpets, even, should not be permitted to remain. The surroundings beget
happiness or gloom, in proportion as they are pleasant or disagreeable. A
tidy attendant, a few flowers and books, wonderfully enhance the
cheerfulness of the room. Permit no unnecessary accumulation of bottles, or
any thing that can in any way render the room unpleasant. Medicines, drink,
or nourishment should never be left uncovered in the sick-room, since they
quickly absorb the gaseous emanations from the patient, and become unfit
for the purpose which they were intended to serve. Their presence gives the
room an untidy appearance, suggestive of filth and slovenliness, and
imparts to the patient a feeling of loathing and disgust for articles of
diet.</p>

<p><b>The Bed</b> should not be of feathers, on account of their <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a>[pg 378]</span>undue
warmth, which causes a sensation of languor throughout the system. A husk
or sea-grass mattress, or even a straw bed, covered with a cotton quilt, is
far preferable. The bedding should be changed frequently. It is better that
the bed should be away from the wall, so as to admit of greater freedom of
movement about it.</p>

<p><b>Pure Air</b>. The air in the sick-room should be kept as pure as
possible. That which is so necessary in health, is indispensable in
sickness. The importance, therefore, of a perfect and free ventilation of
the sick-room cannot be too thoroughly impressed; and yet to properly
secure this end, may call forth a considerable amount of ingenuity on the
part of the nurse. A window should be open, but the current of air must not
be allowed to blow directly upon the patient. One window may be raised from
the bottom and another lowered from the top. This will permit the entrance
of pure air from without, and the exit of the vitiated air from within. The
patient, if sufficiently covered in bed, is not liable to take cold from a
proper ventilation of the room. Especially is this true, when the bodily
temperature is raised by febrile or inflammatory affections. The
<i>temperature</i> of a room is no indication of the <i>purity</i> of the
air. It is a prevalent, but mistaken notion, that when a room is cold, the
air must be pure. Cold air is as readily contaminated with impurities as
warm air, therefore, it is not sufficient that the room be kept cool, but
the air should be frequently changed. During convalescence, great care is
necessary to protect the patient from taking cold. Air which is admitted
into the sick-room should not be contaminated by passing over foul drains,
privies, or other sources of infection, since, instead of invigorating, it
depresses the physical forces and generates disease.</p>

<p><b>Light</b> is as necessary to health as is pure air. Banish either for
any continuous period of time, and serious results follow. The strong,
robust man, when deprived of light, soon degenerates into a feeble, sickly
being, and finally dies.</p>

<p>According to the investigations of the Massachusetts Medical Society, it
was found that absence of sunlight, together with moisture, not only favor
the development of tubercular consumption, but act as an exciting cause. It
is well known that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379"
id="Page_379"></a>[pg 379]</span>persons living in shaded dwellings often
suffer from forms of disease which resist all treatment until proper
admission of light is secured.</p>

<p>The physician to the Emperor of Russia found upon examination that
patients confined in well lighted wards, were four times as liable to
recover as were those in poorly lighted rooms. Children reared away from
the sunlight are apt to be deformed and idiotic, while those partially
deformed have been restored by being admitted to the light.</p>

<p>Patients sometimes wish to have their rooms darkened, because the light
is painful to their weak and sensitive eyes. It is far better to shade the
eyes and admit the sunlight into the room, since its rays cause chemical
changes to take place, which favor the return of health. Many invalids can
ascribe their recovery to the influence of a sun bath. There are, however,
conditions in which the patients should be screened from the light. In such
cases a little arrangement of the curtains or shutters will accomplish all
that is to be desired.</p>

<p>Patients convalescing from acute, or suffering from chronic diseases,
should receive the influence of light in the open air, and be in it several
hours every day. Light and pure air stimulate a healthful development,
induce cheerfulness, hope, and recovery, while darkness begets gloom,
sadness, despondency, disease, and ultimately death.</p>

<p><b>Warmth</b> is essential to the well-being of the patient, and it is
necessary that a proper temperature be maintained in the room. Except in
very warm weather, a little fire should be kept in the room, and at the
same time fresh air should be admitted from without, and a uniform
temperature thus preserved. This arrangement is especially necessary in
localities where great variations in temperature are experienced during the
day and night.</p>

<p>The normal temperature of the body ranges from 98&deg; to 99&deg; Fahr.
The minimum occurs from 2 to 6 A.M.; the maximum, from 1 to 6 P.M. The
deviation of a few degrees from this standard indicates disease, and the
greater the deviation, the greater is its severity. During the early stages
of acute diseases, the animal heat is generally increased, and should be
allayed by bathing, and cooling or acidulated drinks. In the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a>[pg 380]</span>latter
stages, the temperature becomes diminished and the condition of the system
is favorable to congestions, which are most likely to occur between the
hours of 2 and 6 A.M., when the vital powers are lowest. The patient then
becomes feeble, his extremities grow cold, and he has what is termed a
"sinking spell," and perhaps dies. It is during these hours that additional
covering, the application of hot bricks to the feet, and bottles of hot
water to the limbs and body, friction upon the surface, stimulating drinks,
and increased vigilance on the part of the nurse will often save the
patient's life. But, unfortunately, at these hours the nurse is apt to get
sleepy and inattentive, the demands of the patient go unheeded, and a
sacrifice of life is the result.</p>

<p>Persons suffering from chronic diseases, or those in feeble health,
should preserve their vital energies by dressing warmly, by wearing
flannels next to the skin, and by carefully protecting the feet from cold
and moisture.</p>

<p><b>Cleanliness</b> cannot be too thoroughly impressed upon the minds of
those who have the care of the sick. Filthiness is productive of disease
and favorable to its development. Bathing at least once a day, with pure,
soft water and toilet-soap, is strongly urged, and as this is designed for
cleanliness, the temperature of the bath should be made agreeable to the
patient.</p>

<p><b>The Clothing and Bedding of the Patient</b> in acute diseases, should
be changed frequently and thoroughly aired, if not washed. As soon as
removed, these articles should be taken from the room, replaced by others
<i>well aired and warmed.</i> The hands and face of the patient should be
bathed frequently, the hair combed, the teeth brushed, the nails cleaned,
the lips moistened, and everything about him kept clean and tidy. These
observances, although in themselves trifling, promote comfort and
cheerfulness, and contribute largely to the recovery of the sick. All
excretions from the patient should be buried, and not committed to privies
to communicate disease to those who frequent them.</p>

<p><b>The Diet</b> contains a very important relation to health. During the
process of acute disease, the appetite is generally much impaired, if not
entirely absent. It should then be the study of the nurse to devise such
articles of nourishment as will <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381"
id="Page_381"></a>[pg 381]</span>be acceptable to the patient and suitable
to the condition. The food should be light, nutritious, and easy of
digestion.</p>

<p>Each individual disease requires a diet adapted to its peculiarities.
Those of an inflammatory character require an unstimulating diet, as gruel,
barley-water, toast, etc. An exhausted or enfeebled condition of the brain,
unattended by irritability, demands a stimulating diet, as beef, eggs,
fish, Graham bread, oysters, etc. In wasting diseases, in which the
temperature of the system is low, beef, fatty substances, rich milk, sweet
cream, and other carbonaceous articles of diet are recommended. In the
various forms of chronic ailments, the diet must be varied according to the
nature of the disease and the peculiarities of the patient. Deranged
digestion is generally an accompaniment of chronic disease. A return to
normal digestion should be encouraged by selecting appropriate articles of
food, paying due regard to its quantity and quality, as well as to the
manner and time of eating. The appearance of food, and the manner in which
it is offered, have much to do with its acceptance, or rejection by the
patient. Let the nourishment be presented in a nice, clean dish, of a size
and shape appropriate to the quantity. More food than can be eaten by the
patient should not be placed before him at one time, since a great quantity
excites disgust and loathing. In taking nourishment, drink, or medicine,
the patient, if feeble, should not be obliged to change his position.</p>

<p><b>Milk</b> is one of the most important foods in fevers and acute
diseases attended with great prostration, and in which the digestive powers
are enfeebled. It contains within itself all the elements of nutrition.</p>

<p><b>Beef Tea</b> furnishes an excellent nourishment for the sick, but
there are few, even among professional nurses who know how to properly
prepare it. We give three good recipes. One method is to chip up lean beef,
put it in a porcelain or tin saucepan, cover it with <i>cold</i> water, and
bring it up to just below the boiling point, at which temperature <i>retain
it</i> for ten minutes, then season and serve. Another method is similar to
the foregoing, with this difference, that the juices of the meat are
squeezed through a piece of muslin or crash, making the tea richer. Another
way, which we consider preferable to <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a>[pg 382]</span>either of the above, is to
take lean beef, cut it into fine bits, put them in a tightly covered
vessel, which is placed in a kettle of water kept boiling. Thus the whole
strength of the juice will be obtained from the meat without losing any of
its properties. It can be seasoned to the taste, and reduced with water to
suit the needs of the patient.</p>

<p><b>Sleep</b> is "Nature's grand restorer, a balm to all mankind; the
best comforter of that sad heart whom fortune's spite assails." It is
necessary in health, and doubly so in sickness. During sleep, the vital
energies recuperate, the forces are less rapidly expended, and the strength
increases. It is the great source of rest and refreshment. Often a day's
rest in bed, free from the cares and anxieties of an active life, is
sufficient to ward off the approach of disease. If quiet and rest are
essential to recuperation in health, their necessity in disease must be
apparent. Life frequently depends on tranquility and repose, and the least
noise or confusion disturbs the sufferer and diminishes the chances of
recovery. Nothing annoys sick or nervous persons more than whispering and
the rustling of newspapers. If conversation be necessary, let the tones be
modified, but never whisper. In sickness, when the vital forces are low,
the more natural rest and sleep the patient obtains, the greater is the
prospect for recovery. As a rule, <i>a patient should never be awakened
when sleeping quietly</i>, not even to take <i>medicine</i>, unless in
<i>extreme cases</i>. If the patient does not sleep, the cause should be
ascertained and the appropriate remedies employed; if it arise from rush of
blood to the head, cooling lotions should be applied, and warmth to the
feet; if, from restlessness or general irritability, a sponge bath,
followed by friction should be administered; if the wakefulness is due to
noise or confusion, quiet is the remedy. When these means fail, anodynes,
or nervines, should be employed. Lying on the side instead of on the back
should be practiced. Patients afflicted with chronic diseases, on rising,
should take a cold bath, dry the surface quickly with a coarse towel,
followed by friction with the hand. Great benefit may be derived by
following these suggestions when the nature of the disease is not such as
to forbid it.</p>

<p><b>Exercise</b> and rest necessarily alternate with each other. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a>[pg
383]</span>Exercise, so necessary to health, in many forms of disease
greatly contributes to recovery. It sends the sluggish blood coursing
through the veins and arteries with increased force and rapidity, so that
it reaches every part of the system, supplying it with nourishment. It
increases the waste of old material and creates a demand for new.</p>

<p>Convalescing patients, or those suffering from chronic diseases,
whenever the weather will permit, should take exercise every day in the
open air. This should be done with regularity. The amount of exercise must
be regulated by the strength of the patient; never take so much as to
produce fatigue, but, as the strength increases, the exercise may be
increased proportionately. Some interesting employment, commensurate with
the patient's strength, should be instituted, so that the mind may be
agreeably occupied with the body.</p>

<p>When unable to take active exercise, the invalid, properly protected by
sufficient clothing, should ride in a carriage or boat, and each day a new
route should be chosen, so that a change of scenery may be observed, thus
arousing new trains of thought, which will be exhilarating and prove
beneficial to him.</p>

<p><b>Sexual Influences</b>. During the progress of disease or
convalescence, entire continence must be observed. It is then necessary
that all of the vital energies should be employed in effecting a recovery
from disease, without having the additional tax imposed of overcoming the
debilitating effects of sexual expenditure. This holds true with regard to
all diseases, and especially those of the nervous system and genitourinary
organs.</p>

<p><b>Visiting the Sick</b> may be productive of good or evil results.
Mental impressions made upon the sick exert a powerful influence upon the
termination of disease. The chances of recovery are in proportion to the
elevation or depression of spirits. Pleasant, cheerful associations animate
the patient, inspire hope, arouse the vital energies, and aid in his
recovery; while disagreeable and melancholy associations beget sadness and
despondency, discourage the patient, depress the vital powers, enfeeble the
body, and retard recovery.</p>

<p>Unless persons who visit the sick can carry with them joy, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a>[pg 384]</span>hope,
mirth, and animation, they had better stay away. This applies equally in
acute and chronic diseases. It does not matter what a visitor may
<i>think</i> with regard to the patient's recovery, <i>an unfavorable
opinion should never find expression in the sick-room</i>. Life hangs upon
a brittle thread, and often that frail support is <i>hope</i>. Cheer the
sick by words of encouragement, and the hold on life will be strengthened;
discourage, by uttering such expressions as, "How bad you look!" "Why, how
you have failed since I saw you last!" "I would have another doctor; one
who knows something!" "You can't live long if you don't get help!" etc.,
and the tie which binds them to earth is snapped asunder. The visitor
becomes a <i>murderer!</i> Let all persons be guided by this rule: <i>Never
go into the sick-room without carrying with you a few rays of
sunshine!</i></p>

<p>If the patient is very weak the visitor may injure him by staying too
long. The length of the visit should be graduated according to the strength
of the invalid. Never let the sufferer be wearied by too frequent or too
lengthy visits, nor by having too many visitors at once. Above all things,
do not confine your visitations to Sunday. Many do this and give themselves
credit for an extra amount of piety on account of it, when, if they would
scrutinize their motives more carefully, they would see that it was but a
contemptible resort to save time. The sick are often grossly neglected
during the week only to be visited to death upon Sunday.</p>

<p><b>The use of Tobacco and Opium</b>. The recovery of the sick is often
delayed, sometimes entirely prevented, by the habitual use of tobacco or
opium. In acute diseases, the appetite for tobacco is usually destroyed by
the force of the disease, and its use is, of necessity, discontinued; but
in chronic ailments, the appetite remains unchanged, and the patient
continues his indulgence greatly to the aggravation of the malady.</p>

<p>The use of tobacco is a pernicious habit in whatever form it is
introduced into the system. Its active principle, Nicotin, which is an
energetic poison, exerts its specific effect on the nervous system, tending
to stimulate it to an unnatural degree of activity, the final result of
which is weakness, or even <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385"
id="Page_385"></a>[pg 385]</span>paralysis. The horse, under the action of
whip and spur, may exhibit great spirit and rapid movements, but urge him
beyond his strength with these agents, and you inflict a lasting injury.
Withhold the stimulants, and the drooping head and moping pace indicate the
sad reaction which has taken place. This illustrates the evils of
habitually exciting the nerves by the use of tobacco, opium, narcotic or
other drugs. Under their action, the tone of the system is greatly
impaired, and it responds more feebly to the influence of curative agents.
Tobacco itself, when its use becomes habitual and excessive, gives rise to
the most unpleasant and dangerous pathological conditions. Oppressive
torpor, weakness or loss of intellect, softening of the brain, paralysis,
nervous debility, dyspepsia, functional derangement of the heart, and
diseases of the liver and kidneys are not uncommon consequences of the
excessive employment of this plant. A sense of faintness, nausea,
giddiness, dryness of the throat, tremblings, feelings of fear,
disquietude, and general nervous prostration must frequently warn persons
addicted to this habit that they are sapping the very foundation of health.
Under the continued operation of a poison, inducing such symptoms as these,
what chance is there for remedies to accomplish their specific action? With
the system already thoroughly charged with an influence antagonistic to
their own, and which is sure to neutralize their effect, what good can
medicine do?</p>

<p>Dr. King says, "A patient under treatment should give up the use of
tobacco, or his physician should assume no responsibility in his case,
further than to do the best he can for him." In our own extensive
experience in the treatment of chronic diseases, we have often found it
necessary to resort to the same restriction.</p>

<p>The opium habit, to which allusion has also been made, is open to the
same objections, and must be abandoned by all who would seek recovery.</p>
