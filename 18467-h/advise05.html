<h1>DISEASES AND THEIR REMEDIAL TREATMENT.</h1>


<h4>INTRODUCTION.</h4>


<p>Knowledge which is conducive to self-preservation is of <i>primary</i>
importance. That great educator, profound thinker, and vigorous writer,
Herbert Spencer, has pertinently said that, "As vigorous health and its
accompanying high spirits, are larger elements of happiness than any other
things whatever, the teaching how to maintain them is a teaching that
yields to no other whatever. And therefore we assert that such a course of
physiology as is needful for the comprehension of its general truths and
their bearings on daily conduct is an all-essential part of a rational
education."</p>

<p>Believing that the diffusion of knowledge for the prevention of disease
is quite as noble a work as the alleviation of physical suffering by
medical skill, we have devoted a large portion of this volume to the
subjects of physiology and hygiene. These we have endeavored to present in
as familiar a style as possible, that they may be understood by every
reader. Freely as we have received light upon these subjects have we
endeavored to reflect it again, in hopes that a popular presentation of
these matters made plain and easy of comprehension to all people, may lead
the masses into greater enjoyment of life&mdash;the result of a better
preservation of health. This we do in part as a public acknowledgment of
our obligations to society, to whom every professional man is a debtor. He
belongs to it, is a part of its common stock, and should give as well as
receive <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a>[pg
387]</span>advantages, return as well as accept benefits. We know of no
better way to signify our appreciation of the public confidence and
patronage, so generously accorded to us, than to offer this volume to the
people at a price less than the actual cost for an edition of ordinary
size. This we do as a token of the cordial reciprocation of their good
will. In giving to the people wholesome advice, by which they may be
enabled to ward off disease and thus preserve the health of multitudes, we
believe we shall receive their hearty approval, as well as the approbation
of our own conscience, both of which are certainly munificent rewards. We
believe that good deeds are always rewarded, and that the physician who
prevents sickness manifests a genuine and earnest devotion to the common
interests of humanity.</p>

<p>We have no respect for the motives of those medical men who would
withhold that information from the people which will direct the masses how
to take care of themselves, and thereby prevent much sickness and
suffering. Nor is the diffusion of such knowledge antagonistic to the best
interests of the true and competent physician. The necessity for his
invaluable services can no more be set aside by popularizing physiological,
hygienic, and medical truths, than we can dispense with those of the
minister and lawyer by the inculcation of the principles of morality in our
public schools. The common schools do not lessen the necessity for colleges
or universities, but rather contribute to their prosperity. Nor are we so
presumptuous as to anticipate that we could possibly make this volume so
instructive as to render "every man his own physician." No man can with
advantage be his own lawyer, carpenter, tailor, and printer; much less can
he hope to artfully repair his own constitution when shattered by grave
maladies, which not only impair the physical functions, but weaken and
derange the mental faculties. What physician presumes to prescribe for
himself, when suddenly prostrated by serious illness? He very sensibly
submits to the treatment of another, because he realizes that sickness
impairs his judgment, and morbid sensations mislead and unfit him for the
exercise of his skill. If this is true of the physician, with how much
greater force does it apply to the unprofessional! If a sick sea-captain is
unfit to stand at the helm and direct his ship, how utterly incompetent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a>[pg
388]</span>must the raw sailor be when similarly disqualified! Nor is the
physician as competent to treat those near and dear to him, when they are
suffering from dangerous illness, as another medical man not similarly
situated, whose judgment is not liable to be misled by intense anxiety and
affectionate sympathy.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these facts, however, a knowledge on the part of the
unprofessional, of something more than physiology and hygiene, and
appertaining more closely to medicine proper, will many times prove
valuable.</p>

<p>In the first stage of many acute affections which, if unheeded,
gradually assume a threatening aspect, endangering life and demanding the
services of the most skilled physician to avert fatal results, the early
administration of some common domestic remedy, such as a cathartic, or a
diaphoretic herb, associated with a warm bath, a spirit vapor-bath, or a
hot foot-bath, will very often obviate the necessity for calling a family
physician, and frequently save days and weeks of sickness and
suffering.</p>

<p>So, likewise, are there numerous, acute diseases of a milder character
which are easily and unmistakably recognized without the possession of
great medical knowledge, and which readily yield to plain, simple, medical
treatment which is within the ready reach of all who strive to acquaint
themselves with the rudiments of medical science. But in sudden and painful
attacks of acute disease, life may be suddenly and unexpectedly
jeopardized, and immediate relief prove necessary. While under these
circumstances the prompt application of such domestic treatment as good
common-sense may dictate, guided by a knowledge of those first principles
of medical learning which we shall hereafter endeavor to make plain, may
result in speedy and happy relief, yet at the same time there should be no
delay in summoning a competent physician to the bedside of the
sufferer.</p>

<p>Then, and not the least important, there are the various chronic or
lingering diseases, from all of which few individuals indeed, who pass the
meridian of life, entirely escape. In this class of ailments there is
generally no immediate danger, and, therefore, time may be taken by the
invalid for studying his disease and employing those remedies which are
best suited for its removal. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389"
id="Page_389"></a>[pg 389]</span>Or, if of a dangerous or complicated
character, and, therefore, not so readily understood, he may consult either
personally or by letter, some learned and well-known physician, who makes a
specialty of the treatment of such cases, and whose large experience
enables him to excel therein.</p>

<p>In consideration, therefore, of the foregoing facts, we deem it most
profitable for our readers that Part Fourth of this volume should be
arranged in the following manner:</p>

<p>The milder forms of uncomplicated, acute diseases, which may be readily
and unmistakably recognized, and successfully managed without professional
aid, will receive that attention which is necessary to give the reader a
correct idea of them, and their proper remedial treatment.</p>

<p>We shall devote only such attention to the severe and hazardous forms of
acute diseases as is necessary in order to consider their initial stage,
with their proper treatment, not attempting to trace their numerous
complications, or portray the many pathological conditions which are liable
to be developed. For, even by devoting much space to the latter, we could
not expect to qualify our unprofessional readers for successfully treating
such obscure and dangerous conditions.</p>

<p>We shall devote the largest amount of space to a careful and thorough
consideration of those chronic diseases, which, by a little study, may be
readily recognized and understood by the masses, and for the cure of which
we shall suggest such hygienic treatment and domestic remedies as may be
safely employed by all who are in quest of relief. In the more dangerous,
obscure, or complicated forms of chronic diseases, the correct diagnosis
and successful treatment of which tax all the skill possessed by the
experienced specialist, the invalid will not be misled into the dangerous
policy of relying upon his own judgment and treatment, but will be
counseled not to postpone until too late, the employment of a skillful
physician.</p>

<p>The apportionment of space which is made in considering the various
diseases and their different stages, as well as the course which the people
are advised to pursue under the different circumstances of affliction, is
not always in accordance with the plans and recommendations which have been
made by others who have written works on domestic medicine. Most of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a>[pg
390]</span>authors have attempted, by lengthy disquisitions, to teach their
readers how to treat themselves without the services of a physician, even
in the most hazardous forms of disease. In such dangerous maladies as
typhoid, typhus, yellow, and scarlet fevers, typhoid pneumonia, and many
others, in which life is imminently imperiled, such instruction and advice
is decidedly reprehensible, as it may lead to the most serious
consequences. We are confident, therefore, that the manner of disposing of
the different subjects which are discussed in the succeeding chapters, and
the course of action which is advised, will commend themselves to our
readers as being such as are calculated to promote and subserve their best
interests.</p>


<h4>MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS.</h4>


<p>Skill in the art of healing is indicated in three ways: (1.) by
ascertaining the <i>symptoms, seat</i>, and <i>nature</i> of the disease,
which is termed <i>diagnosis</i>; (2.) by foretelling the probable
termination, which is termed <i>prognosis</i>; (3.) by the employment of
efficacious and appropriate remedies, which is called <i>treatment</i>. Of
these three requisites to a prosperous issue, nothing so distinguishes the
expert and accomplished physician from the mere pretender as his ready
ability to interpret correctly, the location, extent, and character of an
affection from its symptoms. By medical diagnosis, then, is understood the
discrimination between diseases by certain symptoms which are
distinguishing signs. Every malady is accompanied by its characteristic
indications, some of which are <i>diagnostic, i.e.</i>, they particularize
the affection and distinguish it from all others.</p>

<p>Medical diagnosis is both a <i>science</i> and an <i>art</i>; a science
when the causes and symptoms of a disease are understood, and an art when
this knowledge can be applied to determine its location and exact nature.
Science presents the general principles of practice; art detects among the
characteristic symptoms the differential signs, and applies the remedy. Da
Costa aptly remarks: "No one aspiring to become a skillful observer can
trust exclusively to the light reflected from the writings of others; he
must carry the torch in his own hands, and himself look into every
recess."</p>

<p>The critical investigation of symptoms, with the view of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a>[pg
391]</span>ascertaining their signs, is essential to successful practice.
Without closely observing them, we cannot accurately trace out the
diagnosis, and a failure to detect the right disease is apt to be followed
by the use of wrong medicines.</p>

<p>General diagnosis considers the surroundings of the patient as well as
the actual manifestations of the disease. It takes into account the
diathesis, <i>i.e.</i>, the predisposition to certain diseases in
consequence of peculiarities of constitution. We recognize constitutional
tendencies, which may be indicated by the contour of the body, its growth,
stature, and temperament, since all these facts greatly modify the
treatment. Likewise the sex, age, climate, habits, occupation, previous
diseases, as well as the present condition, must be taken into account.</p>

<p>Auscultation, as practiced in detecting disease, consists in listening
to the sounds which can be heard in the chest.</p>

<p>Percussion consists in striking upon a part with the view of
appreciating the sound which results. The part may be struck directly with
the tips of the fingers, but more generally one or more fingers of the
other hand are interposed between the points of the fingers and the part to
be percussed, that they, instead of the naked chest, may receive the blow;
or, instead of the fingers, a flat piece of bone or ivory, called a
<i>pleximeter</i>, is placed upon the chest to receive the blow.</p>

<p>Latterly, improved instruments greatly assist the practitioner of
medicine in perfecting this art. The <i>microscope</i> assists the eye, and
helps to reveal the appearance and character of the excretions, detecting
morbid degenerations; <i>chemistry</i> discloses the composition of the
urine, which also indicates the morbid alterations occurring in the system;
by percussion we can determine the condition of an internal organ, from the
sound given when the external surface is percussed; the ear, with the aid
of the <i>stethoscope</i>, detects the strange murmurs of respiration, the
fainter, more unnatural pulsations of life, and the obscurer workings of
disease; with the <i>spirometer</i> we determine the breathing capacity of
the lungs, and thus ascertain the extent of the inroads made by disease;
the <i>dynamometer</i> records the lifting ability of the patient; the
<i>thermometer</i> indicates the morbid variation in the bodily
temperature; various instruments <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392"
id="Page_392"></a>[pg 392]</span>inform us of the structural changes
causing alterations in the specific gravity of fluids, <i>e.g</i>., the
<i>urinometer</i> indicates those occurring in the urine; and thus, as the
facilities for correct diagnosis increase, the art of distinguishing and
classifying diseases becomes more perfect, and their treatment more
certain. While physiology treats of all the natural functions, pathology
treats of lesions and altered conditions.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise128"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 146. Dr. Brown's Spirometer." src="images/advise128.png" /></a><br
/>Fig. 146. Dr. Brown's Spirometer.</p>

<p>By the term <i>symptoms</i> we mean the evidence of some morbid effect
or change occurring in the human body, and it requires close observation
and well-instructed experience to convert these symptoms into diagnostic
signs. Suppose "Old Probabilities" (as we commonly designate the invaluable
Signal Department) hangs out his warning tokens all along our lake borders
and ocean coasts; our sailors behold the fluttering symbols indicating an
approaching storm, but if no one understood their meaning, a fearful
disaster might follow. But if these signals are understood, a safe harbor
is sought and the mariner is protected. So disease may hang out all her
signals of distress, in order that they may be seen, but unless correctly
interpreted, and a remedial harbor is sought, these symptoms are of little
practical value.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the reason why so many symptom-doctors blunder is because
they prescribe according to the apparent symptoms, without any real
reference to the nature of the affection. They fail to discover how far a
symptom points out the seat, and also the progress of a disease. They do
not distinguish the relative importance of the different symptoms. The
practical purpose of all science is to skillfully apply knowledge to
salutary and profitable uses. The patient himself may carefully note the
indications, but it is only the expert physician who can tell the import of
each symptom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a>[pg
393]</span><i>Symptoms</i> are within every one's observation, but only the
physician knows the nature and value of <i>signs</i>. We have read an
anecdote of Galen, who was a distinguished physician in his day, which
illustrates the distinction between sign and symptom. Once, when
dangerously ill, he overheard two of his friends in attendance upon him
recount his symptoms, such as "Redness of the face, a dejected, haggard,
and inflamed appearance," etc. He cried out to them to adopt every
necessary measure forthwith, as he was threatened with delirium. The two
friends saw the <i>symptoms</i> well enough; but it was only Galen himself,
though the <i>patient</i>, who was able to deduce the <i>sign</i> of
delirium&mdash;that is, he alone was able to translate those symptoms into
signs. To determine the value of symptoms, as signs of disease, requires
close observation.</p>


<h4>INTERPRETATION OF SYMPTOMS.</h4>


<p>We shall refer to a few symptoms which any unprofessional reader may
readily observe and understand.</p>

<p><b>Position of Patient</b>. When a patient is disposed to lie upon his
back continually during the progress of an acute disease, it is a sign of
<i>muscular debility</i>. If he manifests no desire to change his position,
or cannot do so, and becomes tremulous at the least effort, it indicates
<i>general prostration</i>. When this position is assumed, during the
progress of continued fever, and is accompanied by involuntary twitching of
the muscles, picking of the bed-clothes, etc., then danger is imminent and
<i>the patient is sinking</i>. Fever, resulting from local inflammation,
does not produce muscular prostration, and the patient seldom or never
assumes the supine position. If this inflammation is in the extremities,
those parts are elevated, in order to lessen the pressure of the blood,
which a dependent, position increases.</p>

<p>For example, let us change the scene, and introduce a patient with head
and shoulders elevated, who prefers to sit up, and who places his hands
behind him and leans back, or leans forward resting his arms and head upon
a chair. The next week he is worse, and no longer tries to lie in bed, but
sits up all the time; note the anxious expression of countenance, the
difficult or hurried breathing, the dry and hacking cough, and observe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a>[pg
394]</span>that the least exertion increases the difficulty of respiration
and causes palpitation of the heart. These plain symptoms signify thoracic
effusion, the collection of water about the lungs.</p>

<p><b>The Countenance</b> displays diagnostic symptoms of disease. In
simple, acute fevers, the eyes and face are red and the respiration is
hurried; but in acute, sympathetic fever, these signs are wanting. We
cannot forget the pale, sharp, contracted, and pinched features of those
patients whose nostrils contract and expand alternately with the acts of
respiration. How hard it was for them to breathe. The contraction and
expansion of the nostrils indicate active congestion of the lungs.</p>

<p>As a general rule, chronic inflammation of the stomach, duodenum, liver,
and adjacent organs, imparts a gloomy expression to the countenance, at the
same time the eye is dull, the skin dusky or yellow, and the motions are
slow. But in lung diseases, the spirits are buoyant, the skin is fair, and
the cheeks flushed with fever and distinctly circumscribed with white, for
delicacy and contrast, almost exceed the hues of health in beauty. Note,
too, the pearly lustre and sparkling light of the eye, the quivering motion
of the lips and chin, all signs of pulmonary disease.</p>

<p><b>The Story of Sexual Abuse</b> is plainly told by the downcast
countenance, the inability to look a person fairly in the face, the
peculiar lifting of the upper lip and the furtive glance of the eye. The
state of the mind and of the nervous system corroborates this evidence, for
there seems to be a desire to escape from conversation and to elude
society. The mind seems engrossed and abstracted, the individual appears
absorbed in a constant meditation, he is forgetful and loses nearly all
interest in the ordinary affairs of life. The whole appearance of a
patient, suffering from spermatorrhea, is perfectly understood by the
experienced physician, for the facial expressions, state of mind, and
movements of the body, all unconsciously betray, and unitedly proclaim his
condition.</p>

<p><b>Tongue</b>. Much may be learned from the appearance, color, and form
of the tongue, and the manner of its protrusion. If pale, moist, and coated
white, it indicates a mild, febrile condition of the system. If coated in
the center, and the sides <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395"
id="Page_395"></a>[pg 395]</span>look raw, it indicates gastric irritation.
If red and raw, or dry and cracked, it is a sign of inflammation of the
mucous membrane of the stomach. If the inflammation is in the large
intestine, the tip of the tongue presents a deep red color, while the
middle is loaded with a dark brown coating. When the tongue is elongated
and pointed, quickly protruded and withdrawn, it indicates irritation of
the nerve-centers, as well as of the stomach and bowels. If tremulous, it
denotes congestion and lack of functional ability; this may be observed in
congestive fevers.</p>

<p><b>Pulse</b>. Usually the pulse beats four times during one respiration,
but both in health and disease its frequency may be accelerated or
retarded. In adults, there are from sixty-five to seventy-five beats in a
minute, and yet in a few instances we have found, in health, only forty
pulsations per minute. But when the heart beats from one hundred and twenty
to one hundred and forty times a minute, there is reason to apprehend
danger, and the case should receive the careful attention of a
physician.</p>

<p>Irregularity of the pulse may be caused by disease of the brain, heart,
stomach, or liver; by the disordered condition of the nervous system; by
lack of muscular nutrition, as in gout, rheumatism, or convulsions; by
deficiency of the heart's effective power, when the pulse-wave does not
reach the wrist, or when it intermits and then becomes more rapid in
consequence of septic changes of the blood, as in diphtheria, erysipelas,
and eruptive fevers.</p>

<p><b>Pain</b>. The import of pain depends on its seat, intensity, nature,
and duration. An acute, intense pain usually indicates inflammation of a
nerve as well as the adjacent parts. Sharp, shooting, lancinating pains
occur in inflammation of the serous tissues, as in pleurisy. A smarting,
stinging pain attends inflammation of the mucous membrane. Acute pain is
generally remittent and not fixed to one spot. Dull, heavy pain is more
persistent, and is present in congestions, or when the substance of an
organ is inflamed, and it often precedes hemorrhage. Burning pain
characterizes violent inflammations involving the skin and subjacent
cellular tissue, as in case of boils and carbuncles. Deep, perforating pain
accompanies <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a>[pg
396]</span>inflammation of the bones, or of their enveloping membranes.
Gnawing, biting, lancinating pain attends cancers.</p>

<p>The location of pain is not always at the seat of the disease. In
hip-disease, the pain is not first felt in the hip, but in the knee-joint.
In chronic inflammation of the liver, the pain is generally most severe in
the right shoulder and arm. Disease of the kidneys occasionally produces
numbness of the thigh and drawing up of the testicle, and commonly causes
colicky pains. Inflammation of the meninges of the brain is often indicated
by nausea and vomiting before attention is directed to the head. These
illustrations are sufficient to show that pain often takes place in some
part remote from the disease.</p>

<p>In chronic, abdominal affections, rheumatic fevers, gout, and syphilis,
the entire system is thrown into a morbid state, the nervous system is
disturbed, and wandering pains manifest themselves in different parts of
the body. Fixed pain, which is increased by pressure, indicates
inflammation. If it be due only to irritation, pressure will not increase
it. Some rheumatic affections and neuralgia not only bear pressure, but the
pain diminishes under it. Permanent pain shows that the structures of an
organ are inflamed, while intermittent pain is a sign of neuralgia, gout,
or rheumatism. Absence of pain in any disease, where ordinarily it should
be present, is an unfavorable sign. Internal pain, after a favorable
crisis, is a bad omen. Or, if pains cease suddenly without the other
symptoms abating, the import is bad. If, however, pain and fever remit
simultaneously and the secretions continue, it is a favorable sign.</p>

<p>A dull pain in the head indicates fullness of the blood-vessels from
weakness, low blood, or general debility. It may be caused by taking cold,
thus producing passive congestion of the brain. It may proceed from gastric
disturbance, constipation of the bowels, or derangement of the liver.
Heaviness of the head sometimes precedes inflammation of the brain, or
chronic disease of its membranes. A dull, oppressive pain in the head
indicates softening of the brain, and is generally accompanied by slowness
of the pulse and of the speech. A pulsating pain of the head occurs in
heart disease, hysteria, and frequently accompanies some forms of
insanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a>[pg
397]</span><b>The Eye</b> indicates morbid changes and furnishes
unmistakable signs of disease. Sinking of the eye indicates waste, as in
consumption, diarrhea, and cholera. In fevers it is regarded as a fatal
symptom. A dark or leaden circle around the eye, seen after hard work,
indicates fatigue and overdoing. If the mucous covering of the inner
surface of the lids and the ball of the eye is congested and inflamed, it
exhibits redness, and may indicate congestion or even inflammation of the
brain.</p>

<p>A dilated pupil is often observed in catarrhal consumption, congestion
of the brain, low fevers, and chlorosis.</p>

<p>The pupil contracts in inflammation of the meninges, when there is
increased sensibility and intolerance of light, also in spinal complaints.
In some diseases the lustre of the eye increases, as in consumption. But if
it decreases with the attack of violent disease, it indicates great
debility and prostration.</p>

<p><b>Examination of the Urine</b>. All medical authors and physicians of
education, freely admit and even insist upon the importance of critically
examining the patient's urine, in all cases in which there is reason to
suspect disease of the kidneys or bladder. In chronic affections it is
particularly serviceable, especially in derangements of the liver, blood,
kidneys, bladder, prostate gland, and nervous system. Many scholarly
physicians have sadly neglected the proper inspection of the urine, because
they were afraid of being classed with the illiterate "uroscopian" doctors,
or fanatical enthusiasts, who ignorantly pretend to diagnose correctly
<i>all</i> diseases in this manner, thus subjecting themselves and their
claims to ridicule. Nothing should deter one from giving to this excretion
the attention it deserves.</p>

<p>The urine which is voided when the system is deranged or diseased is
altered in its color and composition, showing that its ingredients vary
greatly. So important an aid do examinations of the urine furnish in
diagnosing many chronic ailments, that at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute, where many thousands of cases are annually treated, a chemical
laboratory has been fitted up, and a skillful chemist is employed, who
makes a specialty of examining the urine, both chemically and
microscopically, and reporting the result to the attending physicians. His
extended experience renders his services invaluable. With <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a>[pg 398]</span>his
assistance, maladies which had hitherto baffled all efforts put forth to
determine their true character, have frequently been quickly and
unmistakably disclosed.</p>

<p><b>Microscopical Examination</b>. This method of examination affords a
quicker and more correct idea of a deposit or deposits than any other
method. The expert, by simply looking at a specimen, can determine the
character of the urine, whether blood, mucus, pus, uric acid, etc., are
present or not. But when no deposit is present, then it is necessary to
apply chemical tests, and in many cases the quantity of the suspected
ingredient must be determined by analysis. As a detailed account, of the
various modifications which the urine undergoes in different diseases,
would be of no practical use to the masses, since they could not avail
themselves of the advantages which it would afford for correct diagnosis,
except by the employment of a physician who does not ignore this aid in
examining his patients, we shall omit all further details upon the subject.
For the same reason we shall not often, in treating of the different
diseases in which examinations of the urine furnish such valuable aid in
forming a diagnosis, make mention of the changes which are likely to have
occurred.</p>


<h4>INFLAMMATION.</h4>


<p>The term <i>Inflammation</i> signifies a state in which the infected
part is hotter, redder, more congested, and more painful than is natural.
Inflammation is limited to certain parts, while fever influences the system
generally. Inflammation gives rise to new formations, morbid products, and
lesions, or alterations of structure. The morbid products of fever, and its
modification of fluids are carried away by the secretions and
excretions.</p>

<p>The susceptibility of the body to inflammation maybe <i>natural</i> or
<i>acquired</i>. It is natural when it is constitutional; that is, when
there is an original tendency of the animal economy to manifest itself in
some form of inflammation. We may notice that some children are far more
subject to boils, croups, and erysipelatous diseases than others. This
susceptibility, when innate, may be lessened by careful medication,
although it may never be wholly eradicated. When acquired, it is the result
of the influence of habits of life, climate, and the state of mind over the
constitution</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a>[pg
399]</span>Phlegmonous inflammation is the active inflammation of the
cellular membrane, one illustration of which is a common boil. The four
principal symptoms are redness, swelling, heat, and pain; and then appears
a conical, hard, circumscribed tumor, having its seat in the dermoid
texture. At the end of an indefinite period, it becomes pointed, white or
yellow, and discharges pus mixed with blood. When it breaks, a small,
grayish, fibrous mass sometimes appears, which consists of dead, cellular
tissue, and which is called the <i>core</i>.</p>

<p>There are certain morbid states of the constitution which lead to local
inflammation, subsequent upon slight injury; or, in some cases, without any
such provocation, as in gout, rheumatism, and scrofula. One of the first
results of the inflammation, in such cases, is a weakening of the forces
which distribute the blood to the surface and extremities of the body. It
is generally admitted that in scrofulous persons the vascular system is
weak, the vessels are small, and because nutrition is faulty, the blood is
<i>imperfectly organized</i>. The result is failure in the system, for if
nutrition fails, there may be lacking earthy matter for the bones, or the
unctious secretions of the skin; the sebaceous secretion is albuminous and
liable to become dry, producing inflammation of the parts which it ought to
protect.</p>

<p>Disorder of the alimentary canal and other mucous surfaces are sometimes
reflected upon the skin. We have occasionally observed cutaneous eruptions
and erysipelas, when evidently they were distinct signs of internal
disorder.</p>

<p>Inflammation may be internal as well as external, as inflammation of the
brain, lungs, or stomach, and it is frequently the result of what is called
a <i>cold</i>. No matter how the body is chilled, the blood retreats from
the surface, which becomes pale and shrunken, there is also nervous
uneasiness, and frequently a rigor, accompanied with chattering of the
teeth. After the cold stage, reaction takes place and fever follows. The
sudden change from a dry and heated room to a cool and moist atmosphere is
liable to induce a cold. Riding in a carriage until the body is shivering,
or sitting in a draft of air when one has been previously heated, or
breathing a very cold air during the night when the body is warm,
especially when not accustomed to doing so, or exposing the body to a low
temperature when <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400"
id="Page_400"></a>[pg 400]</span>insufficiently clothed, are all different
ways of producing inflammation.</p>

<p>Inflammation may result in consequence of local injury, caused by a
bruise, or by a sharp, cutting instrument, as a knife or an axe, or it may
be caused by the puncture of a pin, pen-knife blade or a fork-tine, or from
a lacerated wound, as from the bite of a dog, or from a very minute wound
poisoned by the bite of a venomous reptile. Local inflammations may arise
from scalds, burns, the application of caustics, arsenic, corrosive
sublimate, cantharides, powerful acids, abrasions of the surface by
injuries, and from the occurrence of accidents.</p>

<p>The <i>swelling</i> of the part may be caused by an increase of the
quantity of blood in the vessels, the effusion of serum and coagulating
lymph, and the interruption of absorption by the injury, or by the altered
condition of the inflamed part.</p>

<p>The character of the <i>pain</i> depends upon the tissue involved, and
upon the altered or unnatural state of the nerves. Ordinarily, tendon,
ligament, cartilage, and bone are not very sensitive, but when inflamed
they are exquisitely so.</p>

<p>The heat of the inflamed part is not so great, when measured by the
thermometer, as might be supposed from the patient's sensations.</p>

<p><b>Termination of Inflammation</b>. Inflammation ends in one of six
different ways. Inflammation may terminate in <i>resolution, i.e</i>.,
spontaneous recovery; by <i>suppuration</i>, in the formation of matter; by
<i>effusion</i>, as the inflammation caused by a blister-plaster terminates
by effusion of water; by <i>adhesion</i>, the part inflamed forming an
attachment to some other part; by <i>induration</i>, hardening of the
organ; or by <i>gangrene</i>, that is, death of the part.</p>

<p>Thus, inflammation of the lungs may terminate by recovery, that is, by
resolution, by suppuration and raising of "matter," by hardening and
solidification of the lung, or by gangrene. Inflammation of the
endocardium, the lining membrane of the heart, may cause a thickening of
it, and ossification of the valves of the heart, thus impairing its
function. Inflammation of the pericardium may terminate in effusion, or
dropsy, and inflammation of the liver may result in hardening and adhesion
to adjacent parts.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a>[pg
401]</span><h4>SEVERAL PRINCIPLES FOR TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION.</h4>


<p>Remove the exciting causes as far as practicable. If caused by a
splinter or any foreign substance, it should be withdrawn, and if the
injury is merely local, apply cold water to the parts to subdue the
inflammation. If caused by a rabid animal, the wound should be enlarged and
cupped, and the parts cleansed or destroyed by caustic. The patient should
remain quiet and not be disturbed. The use of tincture of aconite
internally, will be found excellent to prevent the rise of inflammation. A
purgative is also advised, and four or five of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant
Purgative Pellets will be sufficient to act upon the bowels. If there is
pain, an anodyne and diaphoretic is proper. Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract
of Smart-weed will fulfill this indication. In local inflammation cold
water is a good remedy, yet sometimes hot water, or cloths wrung out of it,
will be found to be the appropriate application. When the inflammation is
located in an organ within a cavity, as the lungs, hot fomentations will be
of great service. Bathing the surface with alkaline water must not be
omitted. Whenever the inflammation is serious the family physician should
be early summoned.</p>


<h4>FEVER.</h4>


<p>In fever all the functions are more or less deranged. In every
considerable inflammation there is sympathetic fever, but in essential
fevers there are generally fewer lesions of structure than in inflammation.
Fever occasions great waste of the tissues of the body, and the refuse
matter is carried away by the organs of secretion and excretion. The heat
of the body in fever is generally diffused, the pulse is quicker, there is
dullness, lassitude, chilliness, and disinclination to take food. We
propose to give only a general outline of fevers, enough to indicate the
principles which should be observed in domestic treatment.</p>

<p>Most fevers are distinctly marked by four stages: 1st, the forming
stage; 2d, the cold stage; 3d, the hot stage; 4th, the sweating or
declining stage. During the first stage the individual is hardly conscious
of being ill, for the attack is so slight that it is hardly perceptible.
True, as it progresses, there is a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402"
id="Page_402"></a>[pg 402]</span>feeling of languor, an indisposition to
make any bodily or mental effort, and also a sense of soreness of the
muscles, aching of the bones, chilliness, and a disposition to get near the
fire. There is restlessness, disturbed sleep, bad dreams, lowness of
spirits, all of which are characteristic of the formative stage of
fever.</p>

<p>The next is the cold stage, when there is a decided manifestation of the
disease, and the patient acknowledges that he is really sick. In typhus and
typhoid fever the chills are slight; in other fevers they are more marked;
while in ague they are often accompanied by uncontrollable shaking. When
the chill is not so distinct the nails look blue and the skin appears
shriveled, the eye is sunken and a dark circle circumscribes it, the lips
are blue, and there is pain in the back. The pulse is frequent, small, and
depressed, the capillary circulation feeble, the respiration increased, and
there may be nausea and vomiting. These symptoms vary in duration from a
few minutes to more than an hour. They gradually abate, reaction takes
place, and the patient begins to throw off the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>Then follows the hot stage, for with the return of the circulation of
the blood to the surface of the body, there is greater warmth, freer
breathing, and a more comfortable and quiet condition of the system. The
veins fill with blood, the countenance brightens, the cheeks are flushed,
the intellect is more sprightly, and if the pulse is frequent, it is a good
sign; if it sinks, it indicates feeble, vital force, and is not a good
symptom. If there is considerable determination of blood to the head it
becomes hot, the arteries of the neck pulsate strongly, and delirium may be
expected. During the hot stage, if the fever runs high, the patient becomes
restless, frequently changes his position, is wakeful, uneasy, and
complains of pain in his limbs. In low grades, the sensibility is blunted,
smell, taste, and hearing are impaired.</p>

<p>The patient in the hot stage is generally thirsty, and if he is allowed
to drink much, it may result in nausea and vomiting. Moderate indulgence in
water, however, is permissible. There is aversion to food, and if any is
eaten, it remains undigested. The teeth are sometimes covered with dark
<i>sordes</i> (foul accumulations) early in the fever, and the appearance
of the tongue <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403"
id="Page_403"></a>[pg 403]</span>varies, sometimes being coated a yellowish
brown, sometimes red and dry, at other times thickly coated and white. The
condition of the bowels varies from constipation to diarrhea, although
sometimes they are quite regular. The urine is generally diminished in
quantity, but shows higher color.</p>

<p>The sweating stage in some fevers is very marked, while in others there
is very little moisture, but an evident decline of the hot stage, the skin
becoming more natural and soft. The pulse is more compressible and less
frequent, the kidneys act freely, respiration is natural, the pains
subside, although there remains languor, lassitude, and weariness, a
preternatural sensibility to cold, an easily excited pulse, and a pale and
sickly aspect of the countenance. The appetite has failed and the powers of
digestion are still impaired.</p>

<p><b>Domestic Management of Fevers</b>. It is proper to make a thorough
study of the early, insidious symptoms of fever, in order to understand
what ought to be done. If it arises in consequence of malaria, the
treatment must be suited to the case. If from irritation of the bowels and
improper articles of diet, then a mild cathartic is required. If there is
much inflammation, a severe chill, and strong reaction, then the treatment
should be active. If the fever is of the congestive variety and the
constitution is feeble, the reaction imperfect, a small, weak pulse, a
tendency to fainting, a pale countenance, and great pain in the head, apply
heat and administer diaphoretics, and procure the services of a good
physician.</p>

<p>As a general rule, it is proper to administer a cathartic, unless in
typhoid fever, and for this Dr. Pierce's Purgative Pellets answer the
purpose, given in doses of from four to six, according to the state of the
bowels. If these are not at hand, a tea of sage and senna may be drunk
until it produces a purgative effect, or a dose of Rochelle salts taken. In
nearly all fevers we have found that a weak, alkaline tea, made from the
white ashes of hickory or maple wood, is useful, taken weak, three or four
times daily, or if there be considerable thirst, more frequently. Some
patients desire lemon juice, which enters the system as an alkali and
answers all purposes.</p>

<p>Diaphoretic medicines are also indicated, and the use of Dr. Pierce's
Extract of Smart-weed will prove very serviceable. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a>[pg 404]</span>Drinking freely of
pleurisy-root tea, or of a strong decoction of boneset is frequently
useful. After free sweating has been established, then it is proper to
follow by the use of diuretic teas, such as that of spearmint and pumpkin
seed combined, or sweet spirits of nitre, in doses of twenty to thirty
drops, added to a teaspoonful of the Extract of Smart-weed, diluted with
sweetened water.</p>

<p>To lessen the frequency of the pulse, fluid extract or tincture of
aconite or veratrum may be given in water, every hour. During the
intermission of symptoms, tonic medicines and a sustaining course of
treatment should be employed. If the tongue is loaded and the evacuations
from the bowels are fetid, a solution of sulphite of soda is proper; or,
take equal parts of brewer's yeast and water, mix, and when the yeast
settles, give a tablespoonful of the water every hour, as an antiseptic.
Administering a warm, alkaline hand-bath to a fever patient every day, is
an excellent febrifuge remedy, being careful not to chill or induce
fatigue. If there is pain in the head, apply mustard to the feet; if it is
in the side, apply hot fomentations.</p>

<p>The symptoms which indicate danger are a tumid and hard abdomen,
difficult breathing, offensive and profuse diarrhea, bloody urine,
delirium, or insensibility. Favorable symptoms are a natural and soft state
of the skin, eruptions on the surface, a natural expression of the
countenance, moist tongue, free action of the kidneys, and regular sleep.
If the domestic treatment which we have advised does not break the force of
the disease and mitigate the urgency of the symptoms, it will be safer to
employ a good physician, who will prescribe such a coarse of treatment as
the case specially requires. It is our aim to indicate what may be done
before the physician is called, for frequently his services cannot be
obtained when they are most needed. Besides, if these attacks are early and
properly treated with domestic remedies, it will often obviate the
necessity of calling upon a physician. If, on the other hand, fevers are
neglected and no treatment instituted, they become more serious in
character and are more difficult to cure.</p>

<p>To recapitulate, our treatment recommends evacuation through nature's
outlets, the skin, kidneys, and bowels, maintaining warmth, neutralizing
acidity, using antiseptics, tonics, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a>[pg 405]</span>and the hand-bath, and the
fluid extract or tincture of aconite, or veratrum to moderate the pulse by
controlling the accelerated and unequal circulation of the blood. It is a
simple treatment, but if judiciously followed, it will often abort a fever,
or materially modify its intensity and shorten its course.</p>


<h4>FEVER AND AGUE. (INTERMITTENT FEVER.)</h4>


<p>The description of fever already given applies well to this form of it,
only the symptoms in the former stage are rather more distinct than in the
other varieties. Weariness, lassitude, yawning, and stretching, a bitter
taste in the mouth, nausea, less of appetite, the uneasy state of the
stomach and bowels are more marked in the premonitory stages of
intermittent fevers. The cold stage commences with a chilliness of the
extremities and back, the skin looks pale and shriveled, the blood recedes
from the surface, respiration is hurried, the urine is limpid and pale,
sometimes there is nausea and vomiting, and towards the conclusion of the
stage, the chilly sensations are varied with flushes of heat. The hot stage
is distinguished by the heat and dryness of the surface of the body and the
redness of the face; there is great thirst, strong, full, and hard pulse,
free and hurried respiration and increased pain in the head and back. The
sweating stage commences by perspiration appearing upon the forehead, which
slowly extends over the whole body, and soon there is an evident
intermission of all the symptoms. In the inflammatory variety of
intermittent fever, all these symptoms are acute, short, and characterized
by strong reaction. Gastric fever, the most frequent variety of
intermittent fever, is marked by irritation of the stomach and bowels, and
a yellow appearance of the white of the eye.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. The cause of the malarial fevers, intermittent,
remittent, and congestive, is supposed to be <i>miasm</i>, a poisonous,
gaseous exhalation from decaying vegetation, which is generally most
abundant in swamps and marshes, and which is absorbed into the system
through the lungs.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. During the entire paroxysm the patient should be kept
in bed, and in the cold stage, covered with blankets and surrounded with
bottles of hot water. The Compound Extract of Smart-weed should be
administered in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406"
id="Page_406"></a>[pg 406]</span>some diaphoretic herb-tea. During the hot
stage, the extra clothing and the bottles of hot water should be gradually
removed and cold drinks taken instead of warm. During the sweating stage
the patient should be left alone, but as soon as the perspiration ceases,
from two to four of the Purgative Pellets should be administered, as a
gentle cathartic. A second paroxysm should, if possible, be prevented. To
accomplish this, during the intermission of symptoms, the Golden Medical
Discovery should be taken in doses of from two to three teaspoonfuls every
four hours in alternation with three-grain doses of the sulphate of
quinine. If the attack is very severe, and is not relieved by this
treatment, a physician should be summoned to attend the case.</p>


<h4>REMITTENT FEVER. (BILIOUS FEVER.)</h4>


<p>The distinction between <i>intermittent</i> and <i>remittent</i> fever
does not consist in a difference of origin. In the former disease there is
a complete intermission of the symptoms, while in the latter there is only
a remission.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The treatment should consist in the employment of
those remedial agents advised in intermittent fever, the Golden Medical
Discovery and quinine being taken during the remission of symptoms. During
the height of the fever, tincture of aconite maybe given and an alkaline
sponge-bath administered with advantage. As in intermittent fever, should
the course of treatment here advised not promptly arrest the disease, the
family physician should be summoned.</p>


<h4>CONGESTIVE FEVER. (PERNICIOUS FEVER.)</h4>


<p>This is the most severe and dangerous form of malarial fever. It may be
either intermittent or remittent in character. In some instances the first
paroxysm is so violent as to destroy life in a few hours, while in others
it comes on insidiously, the first one or two paroxysms being comparatively
mild. It is frequently characterized by stupor, delirium, a marble-like
coldness of the surface, vomiting and purging, jaundice, or hemorrhage from
the nose and bowels. In America this fever is only met with in the
Mississippi valley, and in other localities where the air contains a large
quantity of malarial poison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a>[pg
407]</span><b>Treatment.</b> This fever is so dangerous that a physician
should be summoned as soon as the disease is recognized. For the benefit of
those who are unable to obtain medical attendance, we will say that the
treatment should be much the same as in intermittent fever, but more
energetic. Quinine should be taken in doses of from five to fifteen grains
every two or three hours. If it be not retained by the stomach, the
following mixture may be administered by injection: sulphate of quinine,
one-half drachm; sulphuric acid, five drops; water, one ounce; dissolve,
and then add two ounces of starch water.</p>


<h4>CONTINUED FEVERS.</h4>


<p>The symptoms of these fevers do not intermit and remit, but
<i>continue</i> without any marked variation for a certain period. They are
usually characterized by great prostration of the system, and are called
<i>putrid</i> when they manifest septic changes in the fluids, and
<i>malignant</i> when they speedily run to a fatal termination.
<i>Typhoid</i> and <i>typhus</i> fevers belong to this class. We shall not
advise treatment for these more grave disorders which should always, for
the safety of the patient, be attended by the family physician, except to
recommend some simple means which may be employed in the initial stage of
the disease, or when a physician's services cannot be promptly secured.</p>


<h4>TYPHOID FEVER. (ENTERIC FEVER.)</h4>


<p>In typhoid fever there is ulceration of the intestines and mesenteric
glands. This diseased condition of the bowels distinguishes this fever from
all others, and is readily detected by sensitiveness to pressure,
especially over the lower part of the abdomen on the right side. The early
disposition to diarrhea is another characteristic symptom of it, and there
is also no intermission of symptoms as in intermittent fever. The disease
comes on insidiously, with loss of appetite, headache, chilliness, and
languor. It is usually a week or more before the disease becomes fully
developed.</p>

<p><b>Cause.</b> Typhoid fever is a specific form of fever developed from
the action of a specific germ upon a susceptible system. The poison of
typhoid fever is eliminated mainly through the bowels. The germs of typhoid
can maintain life for months in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408"
id="Page_408"></a>[pg 408]</span>water, and thus it happens that ponds,
lakes, rivers and streams which receive sewage can spread the germs of
typhoid fever. Well water often swarms with these poisonous germs. In some
cases it has been found that privies, though twenty or forty feet away from
a well, have yet drained into it&mdash;through a clay soil covered with
gravel&mdash;and carried the germs to those drinking the water from the well.
Next to water, milk is the most prominent carrier of contagion. Milk is apt
to get infected with the germs if cooled in tanks of water which may
receive drainage from outhouses and barns.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Scientific support has been given the treatment by
cold tub baths (70&deg; Fahrenheit) and it is advised by many physicians.
Experience has proved that sponge baths and tub baths are of the utmost
importance, when the temperature of the patient is at or above 102.5&deg;
Fahrenheit. Every three hours the tub bath is given for twenty minutes at
70&deg; Fahrenheit. These may be tepid at first, gradually cooling to
70&deg;. Frictions are applied to patient in the bath, and he is wrapped in
blankets when taken out to avoid danger of chill, and then given a warm
drink or stimulant. Treatment should be directed by an experienced
physician to suit the symptoms. The evacuations from the bowels should be
thoroughly disinfected with chloride of lime or carbolic acid, that they
may not convey the disease to others. All the sewerage and drain pipes in
the house should likewise be disinfected.</p>


<h4>SCARLET FEVER. (SCARLATINA.)</h4>


<p>This fever takes its name from the scarlet color of the eruption on the
surface of the body. Sometimes it is comparatively mild, and is then called
<i>Scarlatina Simplex</i>; when it is accompanied by a sore throat, it is
termed <i>Scarlatina Anginosa</i>; and when the disease is of a low, putrid
type, it is called <i>Scarlatina Maligna.</i> This disease has three
distinct stages: (1), the stage of invasion; (2), the stage of eruption;
and (3), the stage of desquamation. In the first stage there is pain in the
head, increased heat of the skin, redness and soreness of the throat, and
sometimes nosebleed, diarrhea, or vomiting. The average duration of this
stage is twenty-four hours. The eruptive stage <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a>[pg 409]</span>generally begins on the
second day, though sometimes it is delayed longer, and the scarlet rash
rapidly diffuses itself over the whole body. The redness is vivid and has
been compared to the appearance of a boiled lobster. The stage of eruption
reaches its maximum of intensity on the third day, and it is important that
it does not recede. Redness of the tonsils and throat is one of the early
symptoms which precedes any cutaneous eruption. The tongue also is finely
spotted with numerous red points which mark its papill&aelig;, presenting an
appearance which has been compared to that of a strawberry.</p>

<p>The thirst is urgent, there is no appetite, and vomiting and mild
delirium are common. This stage continues from four to six days, and
sometimes longer. Desquamation (scaling off of the skin) commences at the
decline of the eruption, in the form of minute, branny scales. The duration
of this stage is indefinite, and may end in five or six or may continue ten
or twelve days.</p>

<p>If the inflammation in the throat is very severe, it may terminate in an
abscess, which may also occur in the glands of the neck, and sometimes the
inflammation extends to the lips, cheeks, and eyelids. Gangrene within the
throat occurs in rare instances. The disease is easily communicated, and
usually develops in two to five days after exposure. It occurs most
frequently in the third and fourth years of life. There is no other disease
so simple, and yet so often liable to prove fatal, as scarlet fever; and
for this reason we shall advise the attendance of the family physician.</p>

<p>Domestic treatment may be given as follows, until a physician can be
obtained: Catnip, pennyroyal, or pleurisy-root tea, containing one
teaspoonful of the Extract of Smart-weed, may be given, to drive the rash
to the surface. Cold drinks are suitable to allay the thirst, nausea, and
fever. The sick-room should be kept at a temperature of about 65&deg;
Fahr., and fresh air admitted freely. The patient ought not to be
overloaded with bed-clothes; and the skin should be sponged over twice
daily with tepid water, different parts being exposed successively, and
carefully dried with soft cloths. Soda may be added to the water, but no
soap should be used. The diet should consist of milk, extract of beef, and
soups. Injections may be employed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410"
id="Page_410"></a>[pg 410]</span>to relieve constipation, but purgatives
should be avoided. We repeat that this disease is one which requires the
attendance of the family physician, and great care should be exercised
during recovery, that no bad results may follow.</p>


<h4>SMALL-POX. (VARIOLA.)</h4>


<p>Small-pox is produced by a specific poison, which is reproduced and
multiplied during the progress of the disease. It is contained in the
pustules, and in the excretions and exhalations of affected individuals. It
is established after a period of incubation varying from nine to thirteen
days after infection.</p>

<p>There are two varieties of this disease, known as <i>confluent</i> and
<i>distinct</i> variola; in the former, the vesicles run together, in the
latter, they are separate.</p>

<p>This fever has three stages. The first is that of <i>invasion</i>,
distinctly marked by a chill or a series of chills, which alternate with
flushes of heat. In this stage the tongue becomes coated, there is also
nausea and vomiting, pain in the limbs, back, and particularly in the
loins, the latter symptom being of diagnostic importance. This stage
continues about two days, and if the symptoms are light, it may be expected
that the disease will be comparatively mild, and of the <i>distinct</i>
variety.</p>

<p><i>The stage of eruption.</i> The eruption begins to appear on the skin,
generally on the third day following the attack, though in the throat and
mouth may be discovered round, whitish, or ashy spots, several hours
previous to the appearance of vesicles on the surface of the body. These
are first seen on the face and neck, then on the trunk and upper
extremities, and, lastly, on the lower extremities. The eruption at first
appears in the form of small, red or purple spots, which change the texture
of the skin by becoming more hard, pointed, and elevated. On the fifth day
of the eruption they attain their full size, being softened and depressed
in the center, and hence are called <i>umbilicated</i>. Now a change takes
place, and the vesicles fill with "matter" and become pointed, and there is
a rise in the fever.</p>

<p><i>The stage of suppuration</i> commences thus: the pulse quickens, the
skin becomes hotter, and in many cases of the confluent variety, swelling
of the face, eyelids, and extremities occurs. Frequently there is passive
delirium in this stage, and if diarrhea <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a>[pg 411]</span>sets in, it is an
unfavorable sign. The duration of this stage of the eruption is four or
five days.</p>

<p><i>The stage of desication</i>, or of the drying of the pustules,
commences between the twelfth and fourteenth day of the disease. In the
confluent variety, patches of scab cover all the space occupied by the
eruption, and the skin exhales a sickening odor.</p>

<p><b>The Treatment</b> should have reference to the determination of the
eruption to the surface. If there is thirst, allow cold drinks, ice-water,
or lemonade. Bathing the surface with cold water, breathing plenty of fresh
air, using disinfectants in the room, and taking antiseptic medicine
internally, are proper. Add one part of carbolic acid to six parts of
glycerine, mix from two to three drops of this with an ounce of water, and
of this preparation administer teaspoonful doses frequently. A few drops of
carbolic acid and glycerine may be rubbed up with vaseline, and the surface
anointed with it to prevent pitting. The malady is so grave that it should
be intrusted to the care of the family physician.</p>


<h4>VARIOLOID. (MODIFIED SMALL-POX.)</h4>


<p>Varioloid is a modified form of small-pox. There is less constitutional
disturbance, and very little or no pitting of the skin. Varioloid generally
occurs in persons who have not been fully protected by vaccination. A
person suffering from this modification of the disease may, by contagion,
communicate to another genuine small-pox. The <i>treatment</i> is the same
as that recommended in variola.</p>


<h4>VACCINIA. (COW-POX.)</h4>


<p>The important discovery of vaccination is due to Dr. Jenner, who
ascertained that when the cow was affected by this disease and it was then
communicated to man, the affection was rendered very mild and devoid of
danger, and at the same time it proved a very complete protection against
small-pox. Like most other valuable discoveries introduced to the world, it
encountered bitter prejudice and the most unfair opposition. Now its
inestimable value is generally known and admitted.</p>

<p>In a few cases, in which the quality of the vaccine virus was <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412"></a>[pg
412]</span>deteriorated, its effect is only to slightly-modify small-pox,
and then the disease resembles that caused by inoculation. The operation of
infecting the blood with the <i>kine virus</i> is called
<i>vaccination</i>. All that we know is that when the cow becomes affected
with this disease, and it is then transferred to man, it loses its severity
and serves as a protection against small-pox. In a great majority of cases
this protection is absolute, and only in a very few does it leave the
subject susceptible to small-pox, materially modified. The protection it
affords against small-pox is found to diminish after the lapse of an
indefinite number of years, and hence it is important to be re-vaccinated
once or twice, for instance, after an interval of five years. Between the
second and third months of infancy is the best period for vaccination, and
the place usually selected is the middle of the arm above the
elbow-joint.</p>


<h4>CHICKEN-POX. (VARICELLA.)</h4>


<p>Chicken-pox is an eruptive disease, which affects children, and
occasionally adults. It is attended with only slight constitutional
disturbance, and is, therefore, neither a distressing nor dangerous
affection. The eruption first appears on the body, afterwards on the neck,
the scalp, and lastly on the face. It appears on the second or third day
after the attack, and is succeeded by vesicles containing a transparent
fluid. These begin to dry on the fifth, sixth, or seventh day. This disease
may be distinguished from variola and varioloid by the shortness of the
period of invasion, the mildness of the symptoms, and the absence of the
deep, funnel-shaped depression of the vesicles, so noticeable in
variola.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. Ordinarily very little treatment is required. It is
best to use daily an alkaline bath, and, as a drink, the tea of
pleurisy-root, catnip, or other diaphoretics, to which may be added from
one-half to one teaspoonful of the Extract of Smart-weed. If the fever runs
high, a few drops of aconite in water will control it.</p>


<h4>MEASLES. (RUBEOLA.)</h4>


<p>This is generally a disease of less severity and importance than the
other eruptive fevers, but it is sometimes followed by <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a>[pg 413]</span>serious
complications. The stage of invasion is marked by the symptoms of a common
cold, sneezing, watery eyes, a discharge from the nostrils, a dry cough,
chilliness, and headache. This stage may last four days. Then follows an
eruption of red dots or specks, which momentarily disappear on pressure. On
the fourth day of the eruption the redness of the skin fades, the fever
diminishes, and the vesicles dry into scales or little flakes. The eyes may
be inflamed and the bowels may be quite lax at this stage.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The great object in the treatment is to bring out the
eruption. To effect this, sweating teas are beneficial. The free use of the
Extract of Smart-weed is recommended, and the skin should be bathed every
day with tepid water. Sometimes when warm drinks fail to bring out the
eruption, drinking freely of cold water and keeping warmly covered in bed,
will accomplish the desired result.</p>

<p><b>False Measles</b> (<i>Rose Rash</i>) is an affection of very little
importance and may be treated similarly to a case of ordinary measles.</p>


<h4>ERYSIPELAS.</h4>


<p>There are few adult persons in this country who have not, by observation
or experience, become somewhat familiar with this disease. Its
manifestations are both constitutional and local, and their intensity
varies exceedingly in different cases. The constitutional symptoms are
usually the first to appear, and are of a febrile character. A distinct
chill, attended by nausea and general derangement of the stomach is
experienced, followed by febrile symptoms more or less severe. There are
wandering pains in the body and sometimes a passive delirium exists.
Simultaneously with these symptoms the local manifestations of the disease
appear. A red spot develops on the face, the ear, or other part of the
person. Its boundary is clearly marked and the affected portion slightly
raised above the surrounding surface. It is characterized by a burning pain
and is very sensitive to the touch. It is not necessary for the benefit of
the popular reader that we should draw a distinction between the different
varieties of this malady. The distinctions made are founded chiefly upon
the <i>depth</i> to which the morbid condition attends, and not on any
difference in the <i>nature of the affection</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a>[pg
414]</span>Suppuration of the tissues involved is common in the severer
forms. Should the tongue become dark and diarrhea set in, attended with
great prostration, the case is very serious, and energetic means must be
employed to save life. A retrocession of the inflammation from the surface
to a vital organ is an extremely dangerous symptom. The disease is not
regarded as contagious, but has been known to become epidemic.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The treatment during the initial stage of this disease
should correspond with the general principles laid down for the treatment
of fever. The spirit vapor-bath, with warm, diaphoretic teas, or the
Compound Extract of Smart-Weed may be given to favor sweating. The whole
person should be frequently bathed in warm water rendered alkaline by the
addition of saleratus or soda. The bowels should be moved by a full dose of
the Purgative Pellets. Fluid extract of aconite in small and frequent doses
will best control the fever. The specific treatment, which should not be
omitted, consists in administering doses of ten drops of the tincture of
the muriate of iron in alternation with teaspoonful doses of the Golden
Medical Discovery, every three hours. As a local application, the inflamed
surface may be covered with cloths wet in the mucilage of slippery elm.
Equal parts of sweet oil and spirits of turpentine, mixed and painted over
the surface, is an application of unsurpassed efficacy.</p>


<h4>DIPHTHERIA.</h4>


<p>This is an exceedingly grave, constitutional disease characterized by a
rapid breaking down of the powers of life, together with a peculiar
affection of the throat, in which a disposition to the formation of false
membranes is a prominent feature. The formation of these membranes,
however, is not limited to the throat, but may occur on mucous surfaces
elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>Cause</b>. Infection with the specific germ of the disease by
contagion or inoculation. It can be carried in milk or water, and the germs
can attach themselves to furniture, walls, clothing, etc. A person with
chronic diphtheretic sore throat can infect children or susceptible persons
with the disease in its most acute type by kissing. All persons with sore
throat should avoid kissing&mdash;as this disease is commonly spread in this
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415"></a>[pg
415]</span><b>Symptoms</b>. The symptoms vary in different cases. In some
the disease comes on gradually, while in others it is malignant from the
first. The throat feels sore, the neck is stiff and a sense of languor,
lassitude, and exhaustion pervades the system. Sometimes a chill is
experienced at the outset. Febrile disturbance, generally of a low, typhoid
character, soon manifests itself. The skin is hot; there is intense thirst;
the pulse is quick and feeble, ranging from 120 to 150 per minute. The
tongue is generally loaded with a dirty coat, or it may be bright red. The
odor of the breath is characteristic, and peculiarly offensive, and there
is difficulty in swallowing and sometimes in breathing. Vomiting is
sometimes persistent. If we examine the throat, we find more or less
swelling of the tonsils and surrounding parts, which are generally bright
red, and shining, and covered with a profuse, glairy, tenacious secretion.
Sometimes the parts are of a dusky, livid hue, and, in rare instances,
pallid. The false membrane, a peculiar tough exudation, soon appears and
may be seen in patches, large or small, or covering the entire surface from
the gums back as far as can be seen, its color varying from a whitish
yellow to a gray or dark ashen tint. When it is thrown off, it sometimes
leaves a foul, ulcerating surface beneath. The prostration soon becomes
extreme, and small, livid spots may appear on the surface of the body.
There may be delirium, which is, in fatal cases, succeeded by stupor, or
coma. The extremities become cold; diarrhea, and in some cases convulsions,
indicate the approach of death. Sometimes the patient dies before the false
membrane forms.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The extremely dangerous character of this disease
demands that the services of a skillful physician be obtained at once; and
that his efforts should be aided by the most thorough hygienic precautions,
good fresh air, bathing, and a supporting diet. Prior to the arrival of the
physician, lose no time in using plenty of good brandy or whiskey to offset
the extremely weakening effect of the disease. The employment of alcoholic
stimulation in this disease is almost always used by physicians. Control
the vomiting and allay the thirst by allowing the patient to suck small
pieces of ice every five or ten minutes. Hot fomentations or spirits of
turpentine should be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416"
id="Page_416"></a>[pg 416]</span>applied to the throat. If the physician
does not take charge of the patient by this time, the use of permanganate
of potash, triturated, in strength of one grain to the ounce, in a mixture
of fine sugar of milk and gum acacia, and blown over the parts with an
insufflater every few hours, brings the best results if thoroughly carried
out; or the throat can be swabbed out with the following mixture: chlorate
of potash, four drachms; tincture of muriate of iron, three drachms, syrup
of orange, two ounces; water sufficient to make four ounces; administered
every two or three hours. Inhaling steam or lime-water from a steam
atomizer is especially good. The use of blisters, caustics, active purges,
mercurials, or bleeding, should be condemned. Throughout the whole course
of the disease the strength must be supported by the most nourishing diet,
as well as by tonics and stimulants. Beef tea, milk, milk punch, and brandy
should be freely administered. A competent physician should be called in as
early as possible. The general results of the treatment with antitoxin, if
given on the first, second or third day of the disease, are usually
favorable. There are rarely any immediately bad results from the
injections, and the published testimony of careful observers would tend to
prove that recovery has followed its use in a larger percentage of cases
than under former methods of treatment.</p>


<h4>QUINSY. (TONSILLITIS.)</h4>


<p>This is an acute inflammation of the tonsils, which generally extends
to, and involves adjacent strictures, and is attended with general febrile
disturbance. Its duration varies from four to twenty days. It sometimes
terminates by a gradual return to health (resolution); or by the formation
of "matter" within the gland (suppuration.) When this latter is the case,
the swelling sometimes becomes so great before it breaks as to require
lancing.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. It most frequently results from a cold. In some persons
there is a predisposition to it, and the individual is liable to recurring
attacks. Persons of a scrofulous diathesis are more liable to it than
others.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. Difficulty of swallowing, soreness, and stiffness <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417"></a>[pg 417]</span>of the
throat, are the first monitions of its approach. There is fever, quick,
full pulse, and dryness of the skin; the tongue is furred, and the breath
offensive. The tonsils are intensely red, swollen, and painful, the pain
often extending to the ear. Sometimes but one tonsil is affected, though
generally both are involved. In severe cases the patient cannot lie down,
in consequence of the difficulty of breathing.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In the early stage of the disease, the spirit
vapor-bath is invaluable. The sweating which it produces should be kept up
by the use of the Compound Extract of Smart-weed in some diaphoretic
infusion. Hot wet-packs to the throat, covered with dry cloths, are useful.
The inhalation of the hot vapor of water or vinegar, or peppermint and
water, is beneficial. A carthartic should be given at night. When the
disease does not show a disposition to yield to this treatment, the
services of a physician should be obtained. When pus, or "matter," is
formed in the tonsil, which may be known by the increased swelling and the
appearance of a yellowish spot, the services of a physician will be
required to lance it.</p>


<h3>ENLARGED TONSILS.</h3>




<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise129"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 147." src="images/advise129.png" /></a><br />Fig. 147. <i>A
A.</i>&mdash;Enlarged Tonsils. B.&mdash;Elongated Uvula.</p>

<p>Chronic enlargement of the tonsils, as shown in Fig. 147, <i>A A</i>, is
an exceedingly common affection. It is most common to those of a scrofulous
habit. It rarely makes its appearance after the thirtieth year, unless it
has existed in earlier life, and has been imperfectly cured. Both tonsils
are generally, though unequally enlarged. A person affected with this
disease is extremely liable to sore throat, and contracts it on the
slightest exposure; the contraction of a cold, suppression of perspiration,
or derangement of the digestive apparatus being sufficient to provoke
inflammation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a>[pg
418]</span><b>Causes</b>. Repeated attacks of quinsy, scarlet fever,
diphtheria, or scrofula, and general impairment of the system, predispose
the individual to this disease.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The voice is often husky, nasal or guttural, and
disagreeable. When the patient sleeps, a low moaning is heard, accompanied
with snoring and stentorian breathing, and the head is thrown back so as to
bring the mouth on a line with the windpipe, and thus facilitate the
ingress of air into the lungs. When the affection becomes serious, it
interferes with breathing and swallowing. The chest is liable to become
flattened in front and arched behind, in consequence of the difficulty of
respiration, thus predisposing the patient to pulmonary disease. On looking
into the throat, the enlarged tonsils may be seen, as in the figure.
Sometimes they are so greatly increased in size that they touch each
other.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The indications to be carried out in the cure of this
malady are:</p>

<p>(1.) To remedy the constitutional derangement.</p>

<p>(2.) To remove the enlargement of the tonsil glands.</p>

<p>The successful fulfillment of the first indication may be readily
accomplished by attention to hygiene, diet, clothing, and the use of the
Golden Medical Discovery, together with small daily doses of the Pleasant
Purgative Pellets. This treatment should be persevered in for a
considerable length of time after the enlargement has disappeared, to
prevent a return.</p>

<p>To fulfill the second indication, astringent gargles may be used.
Infusions of witch-hazel or cranesbill should be used during the day. The
following mixture is unsurpassed: iodine, one drachm; iodide of potash,
four drachms; pure, soft water, two ounces. Apply this preparation to the
enlarged tonsils twice a day, with a probang, or soft swab, being careful
to paint them each time. A persevering use of these remedies, both internal
and local, is necessary to reduce and restore the parts to a healthy
condition.</p>

<p>Sometimes the enlarged tonsils undergo calcareous degeneration; in this
case, nothing but their removal by a surgical operation is effectual. This
can be readily accomplished by any competent surgeon. We have operated in a
large number of cases, and have never met with any unfavorable results.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a>[pg
419]</span><h4>ELONGATION OF THE UVULA.</h4>


<p>Chronic enlargement or elongation of the uvula, or palate, as shown at
B, Fig. 147, may arise from the same causes as enlargement of the tonsils.
It subjects the individual to a great deal of annoyance by dropping into
and irritating the throat. It causes tickling and frequent desire to clear
the throat, change, weakness, or entire loss of voice, and difficulty of
breathing, frequently giving rise to the most persistent and aggravating
cough.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The treatment already laid down for enlarged tonsils,
with which affection, elongation of the uvula is so often associated, is
generally effectual. When it has existed for a long time and does not yield
to this treatment, it may be removed by any competent surgeon.</p>


<h4>AN&AElig;MIA.</h4>


<p>When the blood contains less than the ordinary number of red corpuscles,
the condition is known as <i>an&aelig;mia</i>, and is characterized by
every sign of debility. A copious hemorrhage, in consequence of a cut, or
other serious injury, will lessen the quantity of blood and may produce
an&aelig;mia. After sudden blood-letting, the volume of the circulation is
quickly restored by absorption of fluid, but the red corpuscles cannot be
so readily replaced, so that the blood is poorer by being more watery. This
is only one way in which the blood is impoverished.</p>

<p>The blood may be exhausted by a drain upon the system, in consequence of
hard and prolonged study. Severe mental employment consumes the red
corpuscles, leaving the blood thin, the skin cool and pale, and the
extremities moist and cold.</p>

<p>An&aelig;mia may arise from lack of exercise, or it may be occasioned by
mental depression, anxiety, disappointment, trouble, acute excitement of
the emotions or passions, spinal irritation; in fact, there are many
special relations existing between the red corpuscles of the blood and the
various states of the mind and the nervous system. The latter depends
directly upon the health and quantity of these red corpuscles for its
ability to execute its functions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a>[pg
420]</span>An&aelig;mia may arise in consequence of low diet, or because
the alimentary organs do not properly digest the food, or when there is not
sufficient variety in the diet. No matter how an&aelig;mia is occasioned,
whether by labor and expenditure, by hemorrhages, lead poisoning, prolonged
exposure to miasmatic influences, deprivation of food, indigestion,
imperfect assimilation, frequent child-bearing, or lactation, the number of
the red corpuscles in the blood is materially diminished.</p>

<p>The diagnostic symptoms of an&aelig;mia are pallor of the face, lips,
tongue, and general surface, weakness of the vital organs, hurried
respiration on slight exercise, swelling or puffiness of the eyes, and a
murmur of the heart, resembling the sound of a bellows.</p>

<p>This disorder of the blood tends to develop low inflammation, dropsical
effusion, tubercular deposits, Bright's disease, derangements of the liver,
diarrhea, leucorrhea, and is a precursor of low, protracted fevers. This
condition of the blood predisposes to the development of other affections,
providing they are in existence, and often it is found associated with
Bright's disease, cancer, and lung difficulties.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. (1.) Prevent all unnecessary waste and vital
expenditure.</p>

<p>(2.) Place the patient under favorable circumstances for recovery, by
regulating the exercise and clothing entertaining the mind, and furnishing
plenty of pure air.</p>

<p>(3.) Prescribe such a nutritious diet as will agree with the enfeebled
condition of the patient.</p>

<p>(4.) Regular habits should be established in regard to meals, exercise,
recreation, rest, and sleep.</p>

<p>(5.) The use of tonics and stimulants, as much as the stomach will bear,
should be encouraged. Bathe the surface with a solution of a drachm of
quinine in a pint of whiskey.</p>

<p>(6.) Iron, in some form, is the special internal remedy in an&aelig;mia.
Meantime, it is proper to treat the patient with gentle, manual friction,
rubbing the surface of the body lightly and briskly with the warm, dry
hand, which greatly stimulates the circulation of the blood. An&aelig;mia
occurs more frequently in the female than in the male, because her
functions and duties are more likely to give rise to it.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a>[pg
421]</span><h4>APNOEA.</h4>


<p>Apnoea, or short, hurried, difficult respiration, is occasioned by
certain conditions of the blood. When anything interferes with the
absorption of oxygen, or the elimination of carbonic acid, the blood is not
changed from venous to arterial, and becomes incapable of sustaining life.
This morbid condition is termed <i>asphyxia</i>. We often read of persons
going into wells where there are noxious gases, or remaining in a close
room where there are live coals generating carbonic acid gas and thus
becoming asphyxiated, dying for want of oxygen.</p>

<p>Deficiency of oxygen is the cause of apnoea, and sometimes the red
corpuscles themselves are so few, worn out, or destroyed, that they cannot
carry sufficient oxygen, and the consequence is that the patient becomes
short of breath, and when a fatal degeneration of the corpuscles ensues, he
dies of asphyxia. Many a child grows thin and wan and continues to waste
away, the parents little dreaming that the slow consumption of the red
corpuscles of the blood is the cause which is undermining the health.
Sometimes this disease is the result of starvation, irregular feeding,
improper diet, want of care, and, at other times, want of fresh air, proper
exercise, and sunlight.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The first essential to success in the treatment of
this disease, is the removal of the exciting cause. Exercise in the outdoor
air and sunlight, with good, nutritious food, and well-ventilated sleeping
apartments, are of the greatest importance. The bitter tonics, as
hydrastin, with pyrophosphate of iron, should be employed to enrich the
blood and build up the strength.</p>


<h4>LEUCOCYTH&AElig;MIA.</h4>


<p>This term is used to designate a condition in which there is an excess
of colorless blood-corpuscles. In health, the colorless corpuscles should
exist only in the proportion of one, to one or two hundred of the red
corpuscles. These colorless corpuscles increase when there is disease of
the lymphatic glands, but whether this is the cause of their increase or
perversion is not known.</p>

<p>They have been found abundant in the blood in diseases of the spleen and
of the liver. Diarrhea usually attends this <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_422" id="Page_422"></a>[pg 422]</span>complaint, together with
difficult breathing, loss of strength, gradual decline, fever, diminution
of vital forces, and finally death. The recovery of a well-marked case of
this disease is very doubtful. Its average duration is about one year.</p>


<h4>DROPSIES.</h4>


<p><i>Transudation</i> is the passage of fluid through the tissue of any
part of the body without changing its liquid state, while <i>exudation</i>
means, medically, the passage of matter which coagulates and gives rise to
solid deposits. When transudations are unhealthy, they may accumulate in
serous cavities or in cellular structures, and constitute <i>dropsy</i>.
Exudation is the result of inflammation, and the product effused coagulates
and becomes the seat of a new growth of tissue. Exosmosis means the passage
of fluid from within outward, and is a process constantly taking place in
health; while transudation takes place because the blood is watery and the
tissues are feeble and permeable, permitting the serum and watery elements
of the blood to pass into certain cavities, where they accumulate.</p>

<p>The cause of dropsies may be low diet, insufficient exercise,
indigestion, hemorrhages, wasting diseases, in fact, any thing which
impoverishes the blood and increases the relative amount of serum. The
tardy circulation of blood in the veins, or its obstruction in any way, is
a condition highly favorable to the development of dropsy.</p>

<p>General dropsy is called <i>anasarca</i>, and is readily distinguished
by bloating or puffiness of the skin all over the body. This condition is
also called <i>oedema</i>. The skin is pale, yields under the finger
without pain, and preserves the impression for some time. The oedema
usually appears first in the lower extremities, next in the face, and from
thence extends over the body.</p>

<p>General dropsy is commonly due to an impoverished condition of the
blood, and this may be the result of <i>albuminuria</i>, a disease of the
kidneys. Albuminuria is frequently the sequel of scarlatina. Hence, the
utmost care should be taken against exposure of a patient recovering from
scarlatina, and the same caution should be exercised during convalescence
from measles, erysipelas, and rheumatism. Dropsies may be general, as in
anasarca, or local, as dropsy of the heart, called <i>cardiac</i> dropsy:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a>[pg
423]</span>dropsy of the peritoneum, the serous membrane which lines the
abdominal cavity, called <i>ascites</i>; dropsy of the chest, called
<i>hydrothorax</i>; dropsy of the head, called <i>hydrocephalus</i>; dropsy
of the scrotum, called <i>hydrocele</i>.</p>

<p>Dropsy is not, therefore, of itself a disease, but only the symptom of a
morbid condition of the blood, kidneys, liver, or heart. Thus disease of
the valves of the heart, may obstruct the free flow of blood and thus
retard its circulution. In consequence the pulse grows small and weak, and
the patient cannot exercise or labor as usual, and finally the lower limbs
begin to swell, then the face and body, the skin looks dusky, the appetite
is impaired, the kidneys become diseased, there is difficulty in breathing,
and the patient, it is said, dies of dropsy, yet dropsy was the result of a
disease of the heart, which retarded the circulation and enfeebled the
system, and which was actually the primary cause of death.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Dropsy being only a symptom of various morbid
conditions existing in the system, any treatment to be radically beneficial
must, therefore, have reference to the diseased conditions upon which the
dropsical effusion, in each individual case, depends. These are so various,
and frequently so obscure, as to require the best diagnostic skill
possessed by the experienced specialist, to detect them. There are,
however, a few general principles which are applicable to the treatment of
nearly all cases of dropsy. Nutritious diet, frequent alkaline baths to
keep the skin in good condition and favor excretion through its pores, and
a general hygienic regulation of the daily habits, are of the greatest
importance. There are also a few general remedies which may prove more or
less beneficial in nearly all cases. We refer to diuretics and hydragogue
cathartics. The object sought in the administration of these is the
evacuation of the accumulated fluids through the kidneys and bowels, thus
giving relief. Of the diuretics, queen of the meadow, buchu, and digitalis
generally operate well. As a cathartic, the Purgative Pellets accompanied
with a teaspoonful or two of cream of tartar, will prove serviceable.
Beyond these general principles of treatment it would be useless for us to
attempt to advise the invalid suffering from any one of the many forms of
dropsy. The specialist skilled by large <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_424" id="Page_424"></a>[pg 424]</span>experience in detecting
the exact morbid condition which causes the watery effusion and
accumulation, can select his remedies to meet the peculiar indications
presented by each individual case. Sometimes the removal of the watery
accumulation by tapping becomes necessary, in order to afford relief and
give time for remedies to act. We have found it necessary to perform this
operation very frequently in cases of <i>hydrocele</i>, and also quite
often in cases of abdominal dropsy. The chest has also been tapped and
considerable quantities of fluids drawn off, and this has been followed by
prompt improvement and a final cure.</p>


<h4>CASES TREATED.</h4>

<b>Case I.</b> A Canadian gentleman, aged 68, applied at the Invalids
Hotel and Surgical Institute, for examination and treatment. He had
been dropsical for over two years, and had become so badly affected as
to be unable to lie down at night. His legs were so filled with water
and enlarged as to render it almost impossible for him to walk, and
there was a general anasarca. The least exertion was attended with
the greatest difficulty of breathing. He had been under the treatment
of several eminent general practitioners of medicine in Canada but
found no relief. They were unable to discover the real cause of his
ailment, but to the specialist who has charge of this class of diseases at
our institution, and who annually examines and treats hundreds of
such cases, it was at once apparent that the dropsy was caused from a
weakened condition of the heart, which rendered it unable to perform
its functions. He was put upon a tonic and alterative course of treatment,
which also embraced the use of such medicines as have been
found to exert a specific, tonic action upon the muscular tissues of the
heart. He improved so rapidly that in less than two months he was
able to lie down and sleep soundly all night. The bloating disappeared,
his strength improved, and in three month's more he was
discharged perfectly cured.

<p><b>Case II.</b> A man aged 42, consulted us by letter, stating that he
was</p>
troubled with general bloating which had made its appearance gradually
and was attended by general debility and other symptoms which
have been enumerated as common to general dropsy. He had been
under the treatment of several home physicians without receiving any
benefit; he had steadily grown worse until he felt satisfied that if he
did not soon get relief he could not live very long. He was requested
to send a sample of his urine for examination, as we had suspicions,
from the symptoms which he gave, that the cause of his dropsy was
<i>albuminuria</i>, or Bright's disease of the kidneys. On examination of
the urine, albumen in very perceptible quantities was found to be
present. We had, about this time, come into possession of a remedy
said by very good authority, to be a specific in degeneration of the
kidneys when not too far advanced, and we determined to test it
upon this well-marked case. We accordingly prescribed it, together
with other proper tonics and alteratives, at the same time giving the
patient important hygienic advice, which must be complied with if
success is attained in the management of this very fatal malady. Our
patient gradually improved, and in a few months' time was restored to
perfect health, which he has continued to enjoy ever since. From our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425"></a>[pg
425]</span>subsequent experience, embracing the treatment of quite a large
number of cases of Bright's disease of the kidneys, we are satisfied
that it is, in its early stage, quite amenable to treatment.

<p><b>Case III.</b> A man aged 35, single, consulted us for what he
supposed</p>
to be enlargement of the testicles. The scrotum was as large as his
head, and it was with difficulty that he could conceal the deformity
from general observation. The disease was immediately recognized by
the attending surgeon as hydrocele. The liquid was promptly drawn
oft by tapping, and a stimulating injection was made into the scrotum
to prevent re-accumulation. We mention this case only because it is
one among a very large number who have consulted us supposing that
they were suffering from enlargement of the testicles, cancer, or some
other morbid growth within the scrotum, when a slight examination
has shown the affection to be hydrocele, a disease which is speedily
cured by tapping, with a little after treatment. The operation is
perfectly safe and almost entirely painless.

<p><b>Case IV.</b> A lady, aged 24, consulted us by letter enumerating a
long
list of symptoms which clearly indicated abdominal dropsy, resulting
from suppression of the menses. A well-regulated, hygienic treatment
was advised, and medicines to restore the menstrual function by
gradually toning up and regulating the whole system, were forwarded
to her by express. After four months' treatment, perfect recovery
resulted. Cases like this latter are very common and generally yield
quite readily to proper management. No harsh or forcing treatment
for restoring the menstrual function should be employed, as it will not
only fail to accomplish the object sought, but it is also sure to seriously
and irreparably injure the system. The most difficult cases which we
have had to deal with, have been those which had been subjected by
other physicians to the administration of strong emmenagogues in the
vain effort to bring on the menses.</p>

<h4>RHEUMATISM.</h4>


<p>Prominent among constitutional diseases is the one known as
<i>rheumatism</i>. It is characterized by certain local symptoms or
manifestations in fibrous tissues. This term has been applied to neuralgic
affections and to <i>gout</i>, but it differs from each in several
essential particulars. Rheumatism may be divided into (1) <i>Acute</i>, (2)
<i>Chronic</i>, (3) <i>Muscular</i>.</p>

<p><b>Acute Articular Rheumatism</b>. Acute articular rheumatism implies an
affection of the articulations or joints. It usually commences suddenly;
sometimes pain or soreness in the joints precedes the disclosure of the
disease. The symptoms are pain in the joints, tenderness, increased heat,
swelling and redness of the skin. The pain varies in its intensity in
different oases, and is increased by the movement of the affected parts.
Swelling of the joints occurs, especially those of the knee, ankle, wrist,
elbow, and the smaller joints of the hands and feet. The swelling and
redness are generally in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426"
id="Page_426"></a>[pg 426]</span>proportion to the acuteness of the attack.
Acute articular rheumatism is always accompanied with more or less fever.
Sweating is generally a prominent symptom, being strongly acid and more
profuse during the night. The appetite is impaired, the tongue is coated,
the bowels are constipated, or there is diarrhea.</p>

<p><b>The Duration of this Disease</b>. Unlike fevers, its course is marked
by fluctuations; frequently after a few days the pain subsides, the fever
disappears, and convalescence is apparently established, when, suddenly,
all the symptoms are renewed with even greater intensity than before. This
disease rarely proves fatal, unless the heart is involved.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Rheumatism is frequently supposed to be occasioned by a
suppression of the functions of the skin, and is generally attributed to
the action of cold upon the surface of the body. But this acts only as an
exciting cause. It is a disease of the blood. This form of rheumatism
usually occurs between the age of fifteen and thirty, and prevails most
extensively in changeable climates. Acute articular rheumatism seldom
terminates in the chronic form.</p>

<p><b>Chronic Articular Rheumatism</b>. Articular rheumatism, in the
subacute or chronic form, is frequently observed in medical practice. The
symptoms are pain and more or less swelling of the joints, although not of
as grave a character as in acute rheumatism. There is frequently an absence
of increased heat and redness. As in the acute form, the different joints
are liable to be affected successively and irregularly, until, after a
time, the disease becomes fixed in a single joint, and the fibrous tissues
entering into the ligaments and tendons are liable to be affected. The
appetite, digestion, and nutrition are often good, and, in mild cases,
patients are able to pursue their daily vocations. The disease is supposed
to be the same as in the acute form, but milder, and, strange to say, more
persistent. A diseased condition of the blood is supposed to be involved in
both instances, but this morbid state is less extended, and, at the same
time, more obstinate in the chronic than in the acute form. Sub-acute
articular rheumatism is not always chronic, and may disappear in a shorter
time than in the acute form. Chronic articular rheumatism is not generally
fatal, but there is danger of permanent deformities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a>[pg
427]</span><b>Muscular Rheumatism</b>. This affection is closely allied to
<i>neuralgia</i>, and may properly be called <i>myalgia</i>. It exists
under two forms, acute and chronic. In acute muscular rheumatism, there is
at first a dull pain in the muscles, which gradually increases. When the
affected muscles are not used the pain is slight, and certain positions may
be assumed without inducing it constantly; but in movements which involve
contraction of the muscles the pain is very violent. In some cases, the
disease is movable, changing from one muscle to another, but usually it
remains fixed in the muscle first attacked. The appetite and digestion are
not often impaired, and there is no fever. The duration of this form of
rheumatism varies from a few hours to a week or more.</p>

<p>In subacute or chronic muscular rheumatism, pain is excited only when
the affected muscles are contracted with unusual force, and then it is
similar to that experienced in the acute form. The chronic form is more apt
to change its position than the acute. The duration of this form is
indefinite. In both the acute and chronic forms some particular parts of
the body are more subject to the affection than others.</p>

<p>The muscles on the posterior part of the <i>neck</i> are subject to
rheumatic affection. It is termed <i>torticollis</i> or <i>cervical</i>
rheumatism in such cases, and should be distinguished from ordinary
neuralgia. When the muscles of the loins are affected, it is commonly known
as <i>lumbago</i>. In case the thoracic muscles are affected, it is known
as <i>pleurodynia</i>. In coughing, sneezing, and the like, the pain
produced is not unlike that in pleuritis and intercostal neuralgia.</p>

<p>One of the most marked features of muscular rheumatism, is the
cramp-like pain, induced by the movements of the affected muscles, whereas
the pain is slight when those muscles are uncontracted. This feature is
very serviceable in distinguishing muscular rheumatism, or myalgia, from
neuralgic affections. Another trait which distinguishes muscular rheumatism
from neuralgia, is that the former is characterized by great soreness,
while the latter is not. There is also a distinction between inflammation
of the muscles and muscular rheumatism. In the case of the former, there is
continued pain, swelling of the parts, occasional redness, and the presence
of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428"></a>[pg
428]</span>more or less fever, which conditions do not exist in the latter.
Persons subject to rheumatism of the muscles, are apt to suffer from an
attack, after exposure of the body to a draught of air during sleep, or
when in a state of perspiration.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of Acute Rheumatism</b>. Administer the spirit vapor-bath
to produce free perspiration, which should be maintained by full doses of
the Compound Extract of Smart-weed. The anodyne properties of the latter
also prove very valuable in allaying the pain. Tincture or fluid extract of
aconite root may also be employed, to assist in equalizing the circulation,
and also to secure its anodyne action. Black cohosh seems to exert a
specific and salutary influence in this disease, and the tincture or fluid
extract of the root of this plant may be advantageously combined with the
aconite. Take fluid extract of aconite-root, thirty drops; fluid extract of
black cohosh, one drachm; water, fifteen teaspoonfuls; mix. The dose is one
teaspoonful every hour. The whole person should be frequently bathed with
warm water, rendered alkaline by the addition of saleratus or soda. The
painful joints may be packed with wool or with cloths wrung from the hot
saleratus water, and the patient kept warm and quiet in bed. The acetate of
potash taken in doses of five grains, well diluted with water, every three
or four hours, is very valuable in acute rheumatism. Its alkaline qualities
tend to neutralize the acid condition of the fluids of the system, and it
also possesses diuretic properties which act upon the kidneys, removing the
offending blood-poison from the system through these organs. If the joints
are very painful, cloths wet with the Compound Extract of Smart-weed and
applied to them, and covered with hot fomentations, very frequently relieve
the suffering. The majority of cases yield quite promptly to the course of
treatment already advised, if it is persevered in. The disease, however,
sometimes proves obstinate and resists for many days the best treatment yet
known to the medical profession.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of Chronic Rheumatism</b>. The general alkaline baths
recommended in the acute affection are also valuable in the chronic. The
spirit vapor-bath, the Turkish, as well as the sulphur vapor-bath, are all
worthy of a trial in this obstinate and painful disease. Alternatives are a
very valuable <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429"
id="Page_429"></a>[pg 429]</span>class of agents in chronic rheumatism. The
following mixture, in teaspoonful doses three times a day, in alternation
with the Golden Medical Discovery, has proved very successful in this
disease: acetate of potash, one ounce; fluid extract of black cohosh, one
ounce; fluid extract of poison hemlock, two drachms; simple syrup, six
ounces. This thorough alterative course, if well persevered in, together
with the use of alkaline and vapor-baths, will generally prove very
successful. The specialist, however, dealing with chronic diseases
exclusively, will occasionally meet with a case which has been the rounds
of the home physicians without benefit, that will tax his skill and require
the exercise of all his perceptive faculties to determine the exact
condition of the patient's system, upon which the obstinacy of the disease
depends. When this is ascertained, the remedies will naturally suggest
themselves, and the malady will generally yield to them. But, although the
treatment of this disease has entered largely into our practice at the
Invalid's Hotel, and has been attended by the most happy results, yet the
cases have presented so great a diversity of abnormal features, and have
required so many variations in the course of treatment, to be met
successfully, that we frankly acknowledge our inability to so instruct the
unprofessional reader as to enable him to detect the various systemic
faults common to this ever-varying disease, and adjust remedies to them, so
as to make the treatment uniformly successful. If the several plans of
treatment which we have given do not conquer the disease, we can not better
advise the invalid than to recommend him to employ a physician of
well-known skill in the treatment of chronic diseases. If such a one is not
accessible for personal consultation, a careful statement of all the
prominent symptoms, in writing, may be forwarded to a specialist of large
experience in this disease, who will readily detect the real fault, in
which the ailment has its foundation. Particularly easy will it be for him
to do so, if he be an expert in the analysis of urine. A vial of that which
is first passed in the morning, should be sent with the history of the
case, as chronic rheumatism effects characteristic changes in this
excretion, which clearly and unmistakably indicate the abnormal condition
of the fluids of the body upon which the disease depends.</p>

<h1><a name='DISEASES_OF_THE_SKIN'></a>DISEASES OF THE SKIN.</h1>

<h2>ECZEMATOUS AFFECTIONS.</h2>


<p>Eczematous affections constitute a very important class of skin
diseases, the prominent characteristics of which are <i>eruption</i> and
<i>itching</i>. They are progressive in character, passing through all the
successive stages of development, from mere redness of the skin to
desquamation, or thickening of the cuticle. The affections belonging to
this group are <i>eczema, psoriasis, pityriasis, lichen, impetigo, gutta
rosacea,</i> and <i>scabies</i>, or <i>itch</i>. A careful examination of
each of these diseases shows it to be a modified form of eczema, and,
therefore, they demand similar treatment.</p>

<p><b>Eczema</b>. (<i>Humid Tetter, Salt-rheum, Running Scall</i>, or
<i>Heat Eruption</i>.) The term <i>eczema</i> is used to designate the
commonest kind of skin diseases.</p>

<p>In this disease, the minute blood-vessels are congested causing the skin
to be more vascular and redder than in its natural state. There is an
itching or smarting in the affected parts. The skin is raised in the form
of little pimples or vesicles, and a watery lymph exudes. Sometimes the
skin becomes detached and is replaced by a crust of hardened lymph, or it
may be partially reproduced, forming <i>squam&aelig;</i>, or scales. There are
three stages of this disease; the inflammatory, accompanied by swelling,
and the formation of pimples or vesicles; that of exudation, which is
succeeded by incrustation; and that of desquamation, in which the skin
separates in little scales and sometimes becomes thickened. Rarely, if
ever, does the disease pass through these successive stages, but it is
modified by its location and the temperament of the patient.</p>

<p>The many varieties of eczema are designated according to their
predominating characteristics. Thus, when pimples or vesicles are abundant,
it is termed, respectively, <i>eczema papulosum</i> and <i>eczema
vesiculosum,</i> a fine illustration of which may be seen in Colored Plate
I, Fig. 1. Again, when characterized by the eruption of pustules, it is
termed <i>eczema pustulosum</i>, a representation of which may be seen in
Plate I, Fig. 2; and, when the prominent feature is the formation of
scales, it is termed <i>eczema squamosum</i>.</p>

<p>Eczema may be general or partial; in other words, the eruption may
appear in patches or be distributed over the entire surface of the body.
The latter form often appears in infants, but rarely occurs in adults. Two
or more varieties of the eruption may be associated, or one form may
gradually develop into another.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise130"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Plate I. Fig. 1. Fig. 2. Fig. 3. Fig. 4. Fig. 5."
src="images/advise130.jpg" /></a><br />Plate I. Fig. 1. Fig. 2. Fig. 3.
Fig. 4. Fig. 5.</p>

<p>Infants and young children are peculiarly subject to this disorder, and,
if the disease be not promptly arrested, it will assume the severest form
and eventually become chronic. The muscles are soft, the eyes are dull and
expressionless, and the little sufferer experiences the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431"></a>[pg 431]</span>most
excruciating torments. Frequently the whole body is covered with patches of
eczema, the secretions are arrested, and, where the scales fall off, the
skin is left dry and feverish.</p>

<p>Eczema has no symptoms proper, since the morbid feelings are due to
constitutional debility, of which eczema is the result. The <i>signs</i> of
eczema are redness, heat, an itching or smarting sensation, the formation
of pimples or vesicles, exudation, incrustation, the separation of the
cuticle into scales and a gradual thickening of the skin.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Three forms of constitutional derangement predispose the
system to eczema; nutritive, assimilative, and nervous debility. In the
former, there is a diminution of nutritive power, so that the patient
becomes weak and emaciated. Assimilative debility is indicated by an
impaired digestion and a consequent suppression, or an abnormal state of
the secretions. Eczema occasioned by nervous debility, is accompanied by
all the morbid conditions incident to irritation and exhaustion of the
nervous system. Eczema may be excited by a violation of the rules of
hygiene, as undue exposure, or sudden transition from heat to cold,
deficient or excessive exercise, impure air, or improper clothing.</p>

<p><b>Psoriasis</b>. Psoriasis may be defined as a <i>chronic form of
eczema</i>. The transition of the last stage of eczema into psoriasis is
indicated by a tendency of the inflamed, thickened, scaly skin to become
moist when rubbed. It usually appears in patches on various portions of the
body. The skin is parched and highly discolored. The hairs are harsh and
scanty. The patient is constantly tormented by an unbearable itching
sensation and, if the skin is rubbed, it exudes a viscous or sticky fluid.
These are the characteristic signs of psoriasis. It generally appears on
the flexures, folds and crooks of the joints, the backs and palms of the
hands, the arms, and the lower portions of the legs.</p>

<p><b>Pityriasis</b>. (<i>Branny Tetter</i>, or <i>Dandruff</i>.) This
affection is a mild form of psoriasis, from which it may be distinguished
by a more superficial congestion or inflammation of the affected parts, the
absence of swelling, and the formation of smaller scales, having the form
and appearance of <i>fine bran</i>. It generally appears on the scalp,
sometimes extends over the face, and, in rare instances, affects the entire
surface of the body. The signs peculiar to this disease are slight
inflammation, itching, and the formation of minute scales.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Pityriasis is caused by nutritive debility, and is often
associated with erysipelas, rheumatism, and bronchitis.</p>

<p><b>Lichen</b>. (<i>Papular Rash</i>.) Lichen is a term used to designate
an eruption of minute conical pimples, which are more or less transparent,
red, and occasion great annoyance. The eruption is attended with a severe,
hot, prickling sensation, as if the flesh were punctured with hot needles.
The pimples contain no pus, but if opened, they exude a small quantity of
blood and serum. This disease more frequently occurs between the ages of
twelve and fifty, but occasionally appears <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a>[pg 432]</span>during dentition, when it
is called "tooth rash." The lichen pimples are sometimes dispersed singly
over the skin and gradually subside, forming a minute scale, corresponding
in position with the summit of the pimple. When the pimples appear in
clusters, there is a diffused redness in the affected part, and, if they
are irritated, minute scabs will be formed. Lichen generally appears on the
upper portion of the body, as on the face, arms, hands, back, and
chest.</p>

<p>The various forms of lichen are designated according to their causes,
signs, location, manner of distribution, and the form of the pimples.</p>

<p><i>Lichen Simplex</i> is the simplest form of this disorder, and is
indicated by the appearance of minute pimples, which, when the distribution
is general, are arranged like the blotches of measles. Sometimes the
eruption is local and bounded by the limits of an article of clothing, as
at the waist. In eight or ten days, the cuticle separates into minute
scales, which are detached and thrown off; but a new crop of pimples soon
appears and runs the same course, only to be succeeded by another, and thus
the affection continues for months and even years.</p>

<p><i>Lichen circumscriptus</i> is an aggravated form of <i>lichen
simplex</i>, and is characterized by a circular arrangement of the pimples.
The circumference which marks the limit of the patch is sharply defined.
This form of lichen usually appears on the chest, hips, or limbs, and is
not unfrequently mistaken for ringworm.</p>

<p><i>Lichen strophulosus</i> is a variety peculiar to infants.
Dermatologists recognize several subdivisions of this species, but the
general characteristics are the same in all. The pimples are much larger
than in the other forms of lichen, of a vivid red color and the duration of
the eruption is limited to two or three weeks.</p>

<p><i>Lichen urticatus</i> is also an infantile affection and begins with
inflammation, which is soon succeeded by the eruption. In a few days the
pimples shrink, the redness disappears, and the skin has a peculiar
bleached appearance. The eruption is attended by an intense itching
sensation and, if the skin is ruptured, a small quantity of blood is
discharged and a black scab formed. This variety of lichen is very
obstinate and of long duration.</p>

<p><i>Lichen tropicus</i>, popularly known as <i>prickly heat</i>, is an
affection which attacks Europeans in hot climates. It is characterized by
the appearance of numerous red pimples of an irregular form, distributed
over those portions of the body usually covered by the clothing. It is
attended with a fierce, burning, itching sensation, which is aggravated by
warm drinks, friction of the clothing, and the heat of the bed. The
eruption indicates a healthy condition of the system; its suppression or
retrocession is an unfavorable symptom, denoting some internal affection
such as deranged nutrition.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise131"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Plate II. Fig. 6. Fig. 7. Fig. 8. Fig. 9. Fig. 10. Fig. 11. Fig. 12. Fig.
13." src="images/advise131.jpg" /></a><br />Plate II. Fig. 6. Fig. 7. Fig.
8. Fig. 9. Fig. 10. Fig. 11. Fig. 12. Fig. 13.</p>

<p>In <i>lichen planus</i>, as the term indicates, the pimples are
flattened. There is no sensation of itching or formation of scabs. The
pimples are solitary and have an angular base, and the fresh pimples formed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433"></a>[pg
433]</span>appear on the spaces between the former eruptions. This
affection usually attacks some particular region, such as the abdomen,
hips, or chest. Instances are recorded in which it has appeared on the
tongue and the lining membrane of the mouth. Sometimes it appears in
patches, but even then, the margin of each pimple can be discerned.</p>

<p><i>Lichen pilaris</i> and <i>lividus</i> are modifications of lichen
simplex, the former being so named to describe the location of the pimples,
<i>i.e.</i>, surrounding the minute hairs which cover the body, especially
the lower limbs. The term <i>lichen lividus</i> indicates the dark purplish
hue caused by a torpid circulation and the consequent change of arterial
into venous blood before leaving the pimples. <i>Lichen circinatus</i> is a
modified form of <i>lichen circumspectus</i>. The pimples in the center of
the circular patch subside and a ring is formed which gradually increases
in size. When the rings become broken or extend in regular forms, the
affection is termed <i>lichen gyratus</i>.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Constitutional debility predisposes the system to this
eruption. The exciting causes are irritation of the skin, strumous
diathesis, dentition, and any violation of hygienic rules. Although lichen
is not a fatal disease, yet it tends to reduce the vitality of the
system.</p>

<p><b>Impetigo</b>. (<i>Crusted Tetter</i> or <i>Scall</i>.) Impetigo is a
term applied to an inflammation of the skin, more severe and energetic in
its character than the preceding affection. We have found the predominating
characteristics of eczema and lichen to be the presence of exudation in the
former, and the absence of it in the latter.</p>

<p>Impetigo is marked by the formation of yellow pus, which raises the
cuticle into pustules. There is a slight swelling, redness, and the pus
gradually dries up, forming an amber-colored crust, a representation of
which is given in Colored Plate I, Fig. 5. It soon falls, leaving the skin
slightly inflammed, but with no scar. The pustules are sometimes surrounded
by a cluster of smaller ones.</p>

<p>The varieties of impetigo are designated according to the distribution
of the pustules. <i>Impetigo figurata</i>, is characterized by the
appearance of large clusters upon an inflamed and swollen surface,
generally upon the face, but sometimes upon the scalp. This form is
represented in Colored Plate I, Fig. 4. In <i>impetigo sparsa</i> the
pustules are scattered over the whole body.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. The predisposing cause of impetigo is nutritive debility,
and the exciting causes are irritation, impure air, and errors of diet.</p>

<p><b>Gutta Rosacea</b> is a <i>progressive</i> disease, and its successive
stages of development mark the several varieties, such as <i>gutta rosacea,
erythematosa, papulosa, tuberculosa, pustulosa</i>, according as they are
characterized by redness, pimples, tubercles, or pustules. This affection
is attended with heat, itching, and throbbing. The pustules contain serous
lymph, which exudes if the cuticle be broken, and forms a crust at the
summit of the pustule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434"></a>[pg
434]</span>This eruption often appears on the face of persons addicted to
intemperate habits, and has thus received the name of "<i>rum
blossom</i>."</p>

<p><b>Cause</b>. It is essentially a chronic affection, and depends upon
constitutional causes.</p>

<p><b>Scabies</b>. (<i>Itch</i>.) This disease is characterized by a
profuse scaliness of the skin, by an eruption of pimples, vesicles, and, in
rare instances, of pustules. Its prominent feature is an intense itching,
so aggravating that, in many instances, the skin is torn by the nails.
Unlike other diseases of the skin, it is not due to inflammation, but is
caused by animalcul&aelig;, or little parasites, termed by naturalists the
<i>acarus scabiei</i>. This minute animal burrows in the skin, irritating
it, and thus producing the scaliness and itching. The vesicles are
comparatively few in number, and contain a transparent fluid. The pustules
are only present in the severest forms or when the skin is very thin and
tender. It is then termed <i>pustular itch</i>.</p>

<p>The parts usually affected are the hands, flexures of the joints, and
the genital organs. Cases are recorded, in which scabies appeared upon the
face and head, but they are of rare occurrence. The activity of the
animalcul&aelig;, is modified by the vitality of the victim. In persons of
a vigorous constitution, they will rapidly multiply, and, in a few days
after their first appearance, will be found in almost every part of the
body.</p>

<p>Scabies is not confined to any age or sex, but chiefly affects persons
of filthy habits. This disease can only be communicated by contact, or by
articles of clothing worn by an infected person. There are certain
indications which predispose the system to infection, such as robust
health, a hot climate, and uncleanliness.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In all the varieties of eczematous affections, except
scabies, the treatment of which will hereafter be separately considered,
remedies employed with a view to the removal of the constitutional fault
are of the greatest importance. The eruption upon the skin is but a local
manifestation of a functional fault, which must be overcome by alterative
remedies. All the excretory organs should be kept active. To open the
bowels, administer a full cathartic dose of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets.
Afterwards they should be used in broken doses of one or two daily, in
order to obtain their peculiar <i>alterative</i> effects. The use of Dr.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery is also necessary to secure its
constitutional remedial benefits. As a local corrective to relieve the
itching and disagreeable dryness of the skin, add half an ounce of
blood-root to half a pint of vinegar, steep moderately for two hours,
strain and paint the affected parts once or twice daily with the liquid.
Every night before retiring, apply glycerine freely to all the affected
parts, or dissolve one drachm of oxalic acid in four ounces of glycerine
and anoint the skin freely. The white precipitate ointment, obtainable at
any drug store, is an excellent application is most forms of eczema. A tea,
or infusion, of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435"
id="Page_435"></a>[pg 435]</span>black walnut leaves, applied as a lotion
to the affected parts, has also proved beneficial. The surface of the body
should be kept clean by frequent bathing, and thus stimulating its
capillary vessels to healthy activity. The eczematous surfaces should not
be bathed frequently, and never with harsh or irritating soaps. All
varieties of eczematous affections, except scabies, are only temporarily
relieved by external applications, while the <i>radical cure</i> depends
upon a protracted use of alterative, or blood-cleansing medicines.
Therefore, we would again remind the reader of the necessity of keeping the
bowels regular, and removing all morbid taints of the blood and faults of
the secretory organs by the persistent use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery. <i>The successful treatment of scabies</i>, or common itch,
generally requires only local applications, for the object to be obtained
is simply the destruction of the little insects which cause the eruption.
Happily, we possess an <i>unfailing specific</i> for this purpose. Numerous
agents have been employed with success, but <i>Sulphur</i> enjoys the
greatest reputation for efficacy, and, since it is perfectly harmless, we
advise it for this class of disease. Take a quantity of pulverized sulphur
and mix with sufficient vaseline or lard to form an ointment. Having first
divested the body of clothing, anoint it all over freely, and rub the
ointment thoroughly into the pores of the skin while standing before a hot
fire. The application should be made at night before retiring, and the
patient should wear woolen night-clothes or lie between woolen blankets. In
the morning after the application, the patient should take a warm bath,
washing the skin thoroughly and using <i>plenty of soap</i>. This treatment
should be repeated two or three times to be <i>certain</i> of a <i>perfect
eradication</i> of the disease. After this course of treatment, the wearing
apparel as well as the bed-clothes should be thoroughly cleansed, as a
precaution against a return of the disease.</p>

<h1><a name='ERYTHEMATOUS_AFFECTIONS'></a>ERYTHEMATOUS AFFECTIONS.</h1>


<p>The prominent features, eruption, and itching of <i>eczematous</i>
affections are purely local. <i>Erythematous</i> affections are, however,
remarkable for their symptoms of constitutional disorder. Each of these
affections is preceded by intense febrile excitement and nervous debility.
In brief, the local manifestations are simply signs of general internal
disorders; hence, the treatment should be directed to the restoration of
the system. This group includes <i>erythema, erysipelas</i>, and
<i>urticaria</i>.</p>

<p><b>Erythema.</b> A vivid and partial flushing of the face is produced by
a superficial inflammation of the skin, termed <i>erythema</i>. There are
many stages of this disease, from the instantaneous transient flush caused
by emotional excitement, to the protracted inflammation and swelling of
<i>erythema nodosum</i>.</p>

<p>The affection is characterized by a flush which is at first a bright
vivid scarlet, but which changes to a deep purplish tint. There is a slight
elevation of the skin, sometimes accompanied by itching. In the second
stage of development, the flush subsides, the skin has a yellowish or
bruised appearance, and a few minute scales are formed. In <i>erythema
papulosum</i>, a fine representation of which is given in Colored Plate
III, Fig. 18, there is an eruption of red pimples or pustules. The
prominent feature of <i>erythema nodosum</i>, a variety of erythema which
affects those portions of the skin exposed to the sun, is the appearance of
a large swelling, usually lasting four or five days and attended by
constitutional symptoms, such as nausea, fever, languor, and despondency.
The disease is associated with the symptoms incident to a disordered
nervous system and sometimes results fatally, in other cases, it terminates
in melancholy and mania.</p>

<p><b>Causes.</b> The predisposing causes of erythema are constitutional
debility, changes of climate and temperature, and irritating food or
medicines. Locally, it may be produced by friction and the heat of the
sun.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise132"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Plate III. Fig. 14. Fig. 15. Fig. 16. Fig. 20. Fig. 17. Fig. 19. Fig. 18."
src="images/advise132.jpg" /></a><br />Plate III. Fig. 14. Fig. 15. Fig.
16. Fig. 20. Fig. 17. Fig. 19. Fig. 18.</p>

<p><b>Erysipelas.</b> There are few adult persons in this country who have
not, by observation or experience, become somewhat familiar with this
disease. Its manifestations are both constitutional and local, and their
intensity varies exceedingly in different cases. The constitutional
symptoms are usually the first to appear, and are of a febrile character. A
distinct chill, attended by nausea and general derangement of the stomach
is experienced, followed by febrile symptoms more or less severe. There are
wandering pains in the body and sometimes a passive delirium exists.
Simultaneously with these symptoms the local manifestations of the disease
appear. A red spot develops on the face the ear, or other part of the
person. Its boundary is clearly marked and the affected portion slightly
raised above the surrounding surface. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_437" id="Page_437"></a>[pg 437]</span>It is characterized by a
burning pain and is very sensitive to the touch. It is not necessary for
the information of the general reader that we should draw a distinction
between the different varieties of this malady. The distinctions made are
founded chiefly upon the <i>depth</i> to which the morbid condition
extends, and not on any difference in the <i>nature of the
affection</i>.</p>

<p>Suppuration of the tissues involved is common in the severer forms.
Should the tongue become dark and diarrhea set in, attended with great
prostration, the case is very serious, and energetic means should be
employed to save life. A retrocession of the inflammation from the surface
to a vital organ is an extremely dangerous symptom.</p>

<p>The disease is not regarded as contagious, but has been known to become
epidemic.</p>

<p><b>Urticaria.</b> (<i>Hives, or Nettle-Rash.</i>) This word is derived
from <i>urtica</i>, signifying a nettle; it is a transient affection of the
skin, indicated by a fierce, burning, itching sensation and a development
of pustules, or white blotches of various forms. A representation of this
eruption is given in Colored Plate III, Fig. 17. It is appropriately named
nettle-rash, from its resemblance to the irritation caused by the sting of
a nettle. There is the same sharp, tingling sensation and a similar white
wheal or blotch, caused by the muscular spasm of the corium, a layer of the
skin.</p>

<p>Urticaria may be either acute or chronic. Acute urticaria is always
preceded by febrile symptoms and the attack is indicated by a sudden
congestion of the skin, followed by a slight swelling or elevation of the
affected part. When the congestion subsides, the skin has a bruised
appearance. In chronic urticaria, the febrile symptoms are absent.</p>

<p><b>Causes.</b> The exciting causes of urticaria are gastric disorder,
irritation of the mucous membrane, or a sudden nervous shock. The
predisposing causes are conceded to be assimilative and nervous debility.
Hence, it frequently accompanies purpura or land scurvy and rheumatism. The
skin in some persons is so susceptible to irritation that urticaria can be
kindled at any moment by excitement, as an animated conversation, or by the
simple pressure of the hand.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The proper treatment for simple erythema consists in
applying to the affected parts a little lime-water, or sweet-oil, or
glycerine, with the use of warm baths and mild cathartics. This is
generally sufficient to effect a cure, if followed up with the persistent
use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery taken three times a day.</p>

<p>In <i>erysipelas</i> a hot bath, with warm, sweating teas, or, better
still. Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-weed may be given to favor
sweating. The whole person should be frequently bathed with warm water
rendered alkaline by the addition of saleratus or soda. The whole should be
moved by a full dose of the "Pleasant Pellets." Fluid extract of veratrum
viride, in doses of a drop or two every hour will <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_438" id="Page_438"></a>[pg 438]</span>best control the fever.
The specific treatment, that which antidotes the poison in the blood,
consists in administering fifteen-drop doses of the tincture of the muriate
of iron in one teaspoonful of the "Golden Medical Discovery," every three
hours. As a local application, the inflamed surface may be covered with
cloths wet in the mucilage of slippery elm. A preparation of equal parts of
sweet oil and spirits of turpentine, mixed and painted over the surface, is
an application of great efficacy.</p>

<p><i>For urticaria</i>, the "Pleasant Pellets" should be administered in
sufficient doses to move the bowels, the skin bathed with warm water
rendered alkaline by the addition of common baking soda or saleratus, and,
if there be any febrile symptoms, a little tincture of aconite or veratrum
may be administered in one drop doses once each hour. In the chronic form
of the disease, the diet should be light, unstimulating, and easily
digested, the skin kept clean by frequent bathing, and fresh air and
outdoor exercises freely taken. The somewhat protracted use of Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery will result in the greatest benefit in this form
of disease.</p>


<h4>BULLOUS AFFECTIONS.</h4>


<p>The distinguishing feature of this group of cutaneous affections is the
formation of <i>bull&aelig;</i>, or blebs, which are defined as "eminences
of the cuticle, containing a fluid."</p>

<p><b>Herpes</b> is an inflammation of the skin in which the eruption
appears in patches of a circular form. On the second day, minute,
transparent vesicles appear and gradually develop, becoming opalescent. On
the succeeding days, they shrink and produce reddish brown scabs, which
soon become hard and fall off, leaving deep, purplish pits. In adults,
these vesicles sometimes terminate in painful ulcers, caused by an
irritation of the eruption. By some practitioners, herpes is regarded as a
purely nervous disorder, from the fact that it is frequently accompanied by
severe neuralgic pains. These pains are not <i>constant</i>, but
<i>occasional</i>, and do not appear at any definite stage of the disease.
Sometimes they precede and accompany the eruption. Other instances are
recorded in which they remained many years after the disease had
disappeared. The local and constant pain of herpes is a severe burning,
prickling, itching sensation, which remains after the scabs fall.</p>

<p>The three <i>general</i> forms of this disease are <i>herpes zoster</i>,
<i>phlyctoenodes</i> and <i>circinatus</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>herpes zoster</i>, or <i>shingles</i>, the clusters of vesicles
encircle one-half of the body, frequently at the waist; hence, it has
received the name of <i>zona</i> or <i>girdle</i>. The vesicles often
develop into bull&aelig;, and sometimes ulcerate. In <i>herpes
phlyctoenodes</i>, the vesicles are small, round, and irregularly
distributed over the face, neck, arms, and breast. This form is accompanied
by febrile symptoms and offensive excretions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439"></a>[pg
439]</span>In <i>herpes circinatus</i>, or <i>ringworm</i>, the vesicles
appear in circular patches, or rings. This is the mildest form of herpes,
and is not attended by symptoms of constitutional disorder. The various
forms of herpes are represented in Colored Plate I, Fig. 3.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Herpes is not contagious. It is caused by vicissitudes of
heat and cold, violent emotions, excessive exertion, irritation of the
skin, and a general atony of the system.</p>

<p><b>Miliaria</b> is the name given to an eruption of vesicles which are
larger than those of eczema, but smaller than the bull&aelig; of herpes. At
first, the serum contained in the vesicles is perfectly transparent, and
reflects the red tint of the underlying skin, hence the name <i>miliaria
rubra.</i> But gradually it becomes milky and opalescent, hence, the term
<i>miliaria alba</i>. The vesicles of miliaria are generally solitary, and
appear on those portions of the body most liable to become heated and to
perspire. The eruption is preceded by chills, languor, slight fever,
intense thirst, a sharp prickling sensation of the skin, and profuse
perspiration. The vesicles soon desiccate and are replaced by a new
crop.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Miliaria is almost universally an accompaniment of
febrile disease, and all disorders in which there occurs a profuse
perspiration. The causes to which it may be traced in each instance are
improper diet, impure air, burdensome clothing, or strong emotions.</p>

<p><b>Pemphigus</b> is a peculiar eruption which appears upon the limbs and
abdomen. The affected part is of a bright red color, and, in a few hours,
small vesicles appear containing a transparent fluid. The vesicles soon
develop into bull&aelig;, entirely covering the inflamed portion. The fluid
becomes opaque and in a few hours escapes. The patch is then covered with a
yellow scab. Pemphigus may be either acute or chronic. The acute form is
subdivided according to the degree of inflammation, as <i>pemphigus
pompholyx</i> in which it is severe, and <i>pemphigus benignus,</i> when it
is mild. The bull&aelig; of pemphigus are illustrated in Colored Plate III,
Fig. 19.</p>

<p><b>Cause</b>. Pemphigus is always caused by a vitiated state of the
system.</p>

<p><b>Rupia</b> is indicated by an eruption as large as a chestnut
containing a watery fluid, which desiccates into a yellowish-brown crust. A
fine representation of rupia vesicles in both stages of development, is
given in Colored Plate II, Fig. 13.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In all forms of herpes, the administration of a small
dose of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets, with the use of his "Golden Medical
Discovery" in one to two teaspoonful doses three times a day, will be
followed by the happiest results. The skin should be kept clean by the use
of the sponge-bath, rendered alkaline by the addition of common baking soda
or saleratus. The portion of the body covered by the eruption, should be
bathed with a solution of sulphate of zinc, one ounce to a pint of
water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440"></a>[pg
440]</span>Miliaria is generally associated with certain febrile diseases,
and its proper treatment consists in overcoming the febrile and other
constitutional symptoms which accompany the disease. A hot foot-bath and
small doses of tincture of aconite, say one drop in water each hour, will
suffice to remove the fever. If the stomach and bowels are in a vitiated
condition, as they are apt to be, a mild cathartic dose of "Pellets" should
be given.</p>

<p><i>The treatment of pemphigus</i> should consist in frequent alkaline
sponge-baths, and in covering the affected parts with poultices of slippery
elm, which should be kept moist with vinegar, The constitutional treatment
should embrace the persistent use of the "Golden Medical Discovery." When
the disease occurs in children, it is most generally dependent upon
deficient nutrition, and special attention should be given to the diet of
the patient, which should be nutritious. Fresh air and outdoor exercise
ought not to be neglected.</p>

<p>The proper treatment of rupia does not differ from that suggested for
pemphigus.</p>


<h4>NERVOUS AFFECTIONS OF THE SKIN.</h4>


<p>In nervous affections of the skin, the natural sensibility may be
increased, diminished, or perverted. These morbid impressions arise from
the nervous system. Although there are several varieties of these
affections, yet, being of minor importance, we shall omit their
consideration and only speak of one of them in this work.</p>

<p><b>Prurigo</b> affects the entire surface of the body and imparts to the
skin a parched, yellowish appearance. It is characterized by pimples, and
an intense burning, itching sensation. Rubbing and scratching only irritate
the skin, which becomes covered with thin black scabs. A good
representation of <i>prurigo</i> may be seen in Colored Plate II, Fig. 6.
The itching sensations are sometimes caused by chilling the body, by
violent exercise, and heat; allowing the mind to dwell upon the affection
aggravates it. Prurigo is recognized under two forms; <i>vulgaris,</i>
which is a mild form, and <i>senilis</i>, which chiefly occurs in old age,
and is more severe. The external genital parts of females are frequently
affected with this disease, and it is aggravated by menstruation and
uncleanliness.</p>

<p>This affection may be due to a vitiated condition of the blood, and is
common among those who are greatly debilitated. It is frequently occasioned
by uncleanliness, intemperance, the use of unwholesome food, or by an
impure atmosphere.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. To allay the itching, take glycerine, one ounce, add
to it one drachm of <i>sulphite</i> of soda, and one ounce of rose-water,
and apply this to the affected parts. A solution made with borax, two
drachms, and morphine, fire grains, dissolved in six ounces of rose-water,
makes an excellent lotion to allay the itching. If the disease <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441"></a>[pg 441]</span>be
severe, it will be necessary to correct the vitiated condition of the blood
by a protracted use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, and to aid
its effects, give one "Pleasant Pellet" every day, not to operate as a
cathartic, but only to exert an alterative influence.</p>


<h4>ALPHOUS AFFECTIONS.</h4>

<h5>(SCALY SKIN DISEASES.)</h5>


<p>Differences of opinion exist with regard to the proper classification of
these affections. We shall briefly consider <i>alphos</i>, which is
sometimes confounded with <i>lepra</i>.</p>

<p><b>Alphos</b>, which from its Greek derivation signifies <i>white</i>,
is characterized by circular, slightly raised white spots. These eruptions
vary in size from one line to two inches in diameter, and may be scattered
over the entire surface of the body, although they most frequently appear
upon the elbows and knees. Alphos may consist of a single tubercle, or of
large clusters constituting patches. The scales vary in color and
thickness. In Colored Plate III, Figs. 14 and 15, are fine illustrations of
alphos. When a person begins to recover from this affection, the scales
fall off, leaving a smooth red surface, which gradually returns to its
natural color.</p>

<p>This disease is more liable to occur in winter than in summer, although
in some cases the reverse holds true. It may disappear for a time, only to
return again with renewed vigor. It is not regarded as contagious.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Thorough and protracted constitutional treatment is
required to overcome this disease. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery
should be taken internally and also applied locally to the affected parts.
To every other bottle of the "Discovery" which is taken, one-half ounce of
the iodide of potash may be added. One or two of the "Pellets" taken daily
will prove a useful adjunct to the "Discovery."</p>

<p>Locally, we have sometimes applied a lotion made of oxide of zinc,
one-half drachm; benzoic acid, two drachms; morphine, five grains;
glycerine, two ounces. Tincture of the chloride of iron, one drachm in one
ounce of glycerine, makes an excellent local application. Whatever the
local treatment may be, however, we chiefly rely upon the <i>persistent</i>
use of the best alteratives, or blood-cleansing medicines.</p>


<h4>AFFECTIONS OF THE HAIR-FOLLICLES.</h4>


<p><b>Favus</b> (<i>Scald Head</i>) is a disease peculiar to the
hair-follicles, and is indicated by the formation of small yellow crusts,
having the form of an inverted cup. The eruption has a very offensive odor.
When it appears in isolated cups, it is termed <i>favus dispersus</i>, but
it often occurs in large clusters, as represented in Colored Plate II, Fig.
12. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442"></a>[pg
442]</span>and is then termed <i>favus confertus</i>. It generally affects
the scalp, but sometimes extends to the face and neck.</p>

<p><b>Cause</b>. Favus is caused by nutritive debility, which results in a
perverted cell-growth.</p>

<p><b>Sycosis</b> (<i>Barber's Itch</i>) is an inflammatory affection of
the hair follicles of the face. The prominent features of the disease are
redness and the formation of scales. It is peculiar to males. It has
received various names, according to its predominating characteristics,
such as <i>sycosis papulosa, tuberculosa</i>, and <i>fungulosa</i>. Colored
Plate II, Fig. 10, is a line illustration of sycosis as it appears on the
cheek.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Various causes induce the appearance of sycosis. The
general causes are nutritive debility, vicissitudes of heat and cold, and
an exhausted state of the nervous system. It may also result from various
chronic diseases, such as syphilis and dyspepsia.</p>

<p><b>Comedones</b>, or <i>grubs</i>, are due to a retention of the
sebaceous matter in the follicles. The sebaceous substance undergoes a
change, becoming granular and somewhat hardened. It gradually extends to
the mouth of the follicle, where it comes in contact with the atmosphere,
and assumes a dark color, as represented in Plate II, Fig. 8. This fact,
together with its peculiar form when squeezed out of the skin, has caused
it to be termed <i>grub</i>. They often appear in great numbers on the face
of persons whose circulation is not active, or those who are of a
particularly nervous temperament. Stimulating baths and friction will prove
very efficacious in removing these cylinders of sebaceous matter. If they
are allowed to remain, they will produce an irritation of the skin causing
an inflammatory disease known as acne, or stone-pock.</p>

<p><b>Acne or Stone-pock.</b> In the earliest stage of congestion, acne is
characterized by minute hardened elevations of the skin, as shown in Plate
II, Fig. 9, and is termed <i>acne punctata</i>. As the affection
progresses, a bright red pimple, Plate II, Fig. 11, appears, having a
conical form, hence the name <i>acne coniformis</i>. The pimple develops
into a pustule containing yellow "matter," and is then known as <i>acne
pustulosa</i>. This is followed by a thickening of the tissues, termed
<i>acne tuberculata</i>. When the thicker skin is removed, it leaves a deep
scar, hence the term <i>acne indurata</i>.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. The remote cause of acne is nutritive debility. The
immediate causes are rapid growth, an&aelig;mia, improper food, errors of
hygiene, mental exhaustion, and various chronic diseases.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The treatment of favus or scald-head should be
commenced by shaving the hair off close to the scalp and washing the head
thoroughly with soap and water. In some severe cases, it may be necessary
to soften the incrustations with poultices, following these with a free use
of soap and water. Having thus exposed the scalp and thoroughly divested it
of incrustations, apply to it the ointment of iodide of sulphur, which may
be procured at any good drug store. It <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_443" id="Page_443"></a>[pg 443]</span>should be gently rubbed
over the parts night and morning. The scalp ought to be kept perfectly
clean throughout the treatment. Instead of the foregoing, the following may
be applied: Take oxalic acid, ten grains; creosote, twenty drops; water,
two ounces; mix. Half an hour after using this lotion, anoint the head
freely with butter or lard; it will add greatly to the efficacy of the
treatment. But while local applications will relieve many skin diseases and
mitigate suffering, we cannot too strongly impress upon the minds of our
readers the importance, in this as in all other chronic diseases of the
skin, of perseverance in the use of the best alteratives. In this class of
agents Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery stands pre-eminent. Its
efficacy may be increased in this disease by adding to each bottle one
ounce of the acetate of potash, and, when thus modified, it may be
administered in the same manner as if no addition had been made to it.</p>

<p><i>The Treatment of Sycosis</i> should be essentially the same as that
suggested for favus, and it will result in prompt relief and a permanent
cure.</p>

<p><i>Treatment of Acne.</i> In the treatment of this, as in that of other
diseases, we should seek to ascertain the cause, and, when possible, remove
it. Outdoor exercise, a spare, unstimulating diet, and perfect cleanliness
are of the first importance. The affected parts should be bathed with warm
water and Castile, or, what is better, carbolic soap. Washing the face in
cold water generally aggravates the disease. As a local application to the
pustules, we have used with good results the following lotion: Oxide of
zinc, twenty grains; morphine, five grains; glycerine, two ounces: mix.
First having washed the affected parts thoroughly, apply this compound. Our
chief reliance, however, as in the preceding diseases, should be upon the
persistent use of alteratives and mild cathartics or laxatives.</p>


<h4>FURUNCULAR AFFECTIONS.</h4> <h5>(BOIL-LIKE AFFECTIONS.)</h5>


<p>Under this head properly belong boils, carbuncles, and styes.</p>

<p><b>Boils.</b> These annoying affections are hard, prominent,
circumscribed, inflamed, suppurating tumors, having their seat in the
cellular tissue beneath the skin. They vary in size from a pea to a hen's
egg, and may occur on any part of the body. The color of a boil varies from
deep red to mahogany. It is painful, tender, advances rapidly to maturity,
becomes conical, and finally bursts and discharges bloody "matter." Through
the opening, and filling the cavity, may be seen a piece of sloughing
cellular tissue which is called the <i>core</i>. In from four to fifteen
days, it is all expelled and the sore rapidly heals. The causes are an
impure condition of the blood, which generally arises from imperfect action
of the liver or kidneys.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Spirits of turpentine applied to a boll <i>in its
earliest <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444"></a>[pg
444]</span>stage</i> will almost always cause it to disappear; but when
suppuration has commenced it should be favored by the application of
poultices. Next purify the blood to prevent subsequent returns to other
parts of the body. For this purpose take Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery. One or two "Pleasant Pellets" each day will aid in the cure.</p>


<h4>CARBUNCLE. (ANTHRAX.)</h4>


<p>These are more violent, larger, and more painful than boils, which they
resemble. They may spring from several small pimples which extend deep into
the tissues, and on the surface frequently several small vesicles appear
and break. They may discharge, through one or several openings, a thin
acrid, bloody, or dark-colored fluid. They most frequently appear upon the
back of the neck, back, back part of the limbs, and under the arms. Their
presence is evidence of a depressed condition of vitality. These tumors
vary in size from one-half an inch to six inches in diameter, and rapidly
proceed to a gangrenous condition, a grayish slough being detached from the
healthy tissue.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. Invigorate the system by every possible means. The
bitter tonics, such as Golden Seal, Gentian, or Willow, together with
quinine and iron should be used. Nutritious diet, pure air, etc., are
necessary. Purify the blood to remove the causes of the disease. For this
purpose, give the "Golden Medical Discovery" in as large doses as can be
borne without acting too freely on the bowels. Anodynes may be necessary to
overcome the pain. Poultices are useful to encourage the separation of the
dead from the living tissues. Antiseptic dressings are beneficial, of which
carbolic acid is to be preferred; yeast, however, may be employed.</p>

<p>Sometimes powerful caustics or free incisions are productive of
gratifying results, if followed by appropriate dressings, but these extreme
measures should only be resorted to by the direction of a physician.</p>

<p>For a considerable time after the urgent symptoms have subsided, the
"Golden Medical Discovery" should be used, to purify and enrich the blood,
and the bitter tonics and iron may be alternated with it, or be used
conjointly to good advantage.</p>

<h1><a name='SCROFULA'></a>SCROFULA.</h1>


<p>It is estimated that about one fifth of the human family are afflicted
with scrofula. A disease so prevalent and so destructive to life, should
enlist universal attention and the best efforts of medical men in devising
the most successful treatment for its cure. It varies in the intensity of
its manifestation, from the slightest eruption upon the skin (scrofulous
eczema), to that most fatal of maladies, pulmonary consumption.</p>

<p><b>The Scrofulous Diathesis</b>. The existence of a certain disposition
or habit of body designated as the <i>scrofulous</i> or <i>strumous
diathesis</i>, is generally recognized by medical practitioners and writers
as a constitutional condition predisposing many children to the development
of this disease. Enlargement of the head and abdomen, fair, soft and
transparent or dark, sallow, greasy or wax-looking skin, and precocious
intellect are supposed to indicate this diathesis.</p>

<p>The characteristic feature of this disease, in all the multifarious
forms that it assumes, is the formation of tubercle, which, when the malady
is fully developed, is an ever-present and distinguishing element.</p>

<p><i>Tuberculous</i> is therefore almost synonymous with
<i>scrofulous</i>, and to facilitate an acquaintance with a large list of
very prevalent maladies, we may generalize, and classify them all under
this generic term. As <i>tubercle</i> is frequently spoken of in works
treating on medicine and surgery, playing, as it does, a conspicuous part
in an important list of diseases, the reader may very naturally be led to
inquire:</p>

<p><b>What is Tubercle</b>? As employed in pathology, the term is usually
applied to a species of degeneration, or morbid development of a pale
yellow color, having, in its crude condition, a consistence analogous to
that of pretty firm cheese. The physical properties of tubercle are not
uniform, however. They vary with age and other circumstances. Some are hard
and calcareous, while others are soft and pus-like. The color varies from a
light yellow, or almost white, to a dark gray.</p>

<p>It is almost wholly composed of albumen united with a small amount of
earthy salts, as phosphate and carbonate of lime, with a trace of the
soluble salts of soda.</p>

<p>The existence of tubercular deposits in the tissues of the body, which
characterizes scrofula, when fully developed, must not, however, be
regarded as the primary affection. Its formation is the result of
disordered nutrition. The products of digestion are not fully elaborated,
and pass into the blood imperfected, in which condition they are unable to
fulfill their normal destiny&mdash;the repair of the bodily tissues. Imperfectly
formed albuminous matter oozes out from the blood, and infiltrates the
tissues, but it has little tendency to take on cell-forms <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446"></a>[pg 446]</span>or
undergo the vital transformation essential to becoming a part of the
tissues. Instead of nutritive energy, which by assimilation produces
perfect bodily textures, this function, in the scrofulous diathesis, is
deranged by debility, and there is left in the tissues an imperfectly
organized particle, incapable of undergoing a complete vital change, around
which cluster other particles of tubercular matter, forming little grains,
like millet seed, or growing, by new accretions of like particles, to
masses of more extensive size. As tubercle is but a semi-organized
substance, of deficient vitality, it is very prone to disintegration and
suppuration. Being foreign to the tissues in which it is embedded, like a
thorn in the flesh, it excites a passive form of inflammation, and from
lack of inherent vital energy it is apt to decompose and cause the
formation of pus. Hence, infiltration of the muscles, glands, or other soft
parts with tuberculous matter, when inflammation is aroused by its
presence, and by an exciting cause, give rise to abscesses, as in lumbar or
psoas abscesses. When occurring in the joints, tubercles may give rise to
chronic suppurative inflammation, as in white swellings and hip-joint
disease. Various skin diseases are regarded as local expressions of, or as
being materially modified by, the scrofulous diathesis, as eczema,
impetigo, and lupus. The disease popularly known as "<i>fever-sore</i>" is
another form of scrofulous manifestation, affecting the shafts of the
bones, and causing disorganization and decay of their structure. Discharges
from the ear, bronchitis, chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucous
membrane, and chronic diarrhea are frequently due to scrofula, while
pulmonary consumption is unanimously regarded as a purely scrofulous
affectation. Scrofula shows a strong disposition to manifest itself in the
lymphatic glands, particularly in the superficial ones of the neck. The
most distinguishing feature of this form of the disease is the appearance
of little kernels or tumors about the neck. These often remain about the
same size, neither increasing nor diminishing, until finally, without
having caused much inconvenience, they disappear. After a time these glands
may again enlarge, with more or less pain accompanying the process. As the
disease progresses, the pain increases, and the parts become hot and
swollen. At length the "matter" which has been forming beneath, finds its
way to the surface and is discharged in the form of thin pus, frequently
containing little particles or flakes of tubercular matter. During the
inflammatory process there may be more or less febrile movement, paleness
of the surface, languor, impaired appetite, night sweats, and general
feebleness of the system. The resulting open ulcers show little disposition
to heal.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. There is a train of symptoms characteristic of all
scrofulous disease. The appetite may be altogether lost or feeble, or in
extreme cases, voracious. In some instances there is an unusual disposition
to eat fatty substances. The general derangement of the alimentary
functions is indicated by a red, glazed or furrowed appearance of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447"></a>[pg 447]</span>the
tongue, flatulent condition of the stomach, and bloated state of the
bowels, followed by diarrhea or manifesting obstinate constipation. Thirst
and frequent acid eructations accompany the imperfect digestion. The foul
breath, early decay of the teeth, the slimy, glairy stools, having the
appearance of the white of eggs, and an intolerable fetor, all are
indicative of the scrofulous tendencies of the system.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Scrofula may be attributed to various causes. Observation
has shown that ill-assorted marriages are a prolific source of scrofula.
Both parents may be not only healthy and free from hereditary taints, but
robust, well-formed physically, perfectly developed, and yet not one of
their children be free from this dire disease. It may present itself in the
form of hip disease, white swelling, "fever-sore" suppurating glands,
curvature of the spine, rickets, ulcers, pulmonary consumption, or some
skin disease, in every case showing the original perversion of the
constitution and functions. Scrofula is hereditary when the disease, or the
diathesis which predisposes to its development, is transmitted from one or
both parents who are affected by it, or who are deficient in constitutional
energy, showing feeble nutrition, lack of circulatory force, and a
diminished vitality. All these conditions indicate that a few exposures and
severe colds are often sufficient to produce a train of symptoms, which
terminate in pulmonary or other strumous affections. Whatever deranges the
function of nutrition is favorable to the development of scrofula,
therefore, irregularities and various excesses tend to inaugurate it.
Depletion of the blood by drastic and poisonous medicines, such as antimony
and mercurials, hemorrhages and blood-letting, syphilis, excessive mental
or physical labor, as well as a too early use and abuse of the sexual
organs, all tend to waste the blood, reduce the tone of the system, and
develop scrofula.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise133"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 1. A Scrofulous Tumor" src="images/advise133.png" /></a><br />Fig. 1.
A Scrofulous Tumor</p>

<p>Scrofula may be the consequence of insufficient nourishment, resulting
from subsisting upon poor food, or a too exclusively vegetable diet, with
little or no animal food.</p>

<p>Want of exercise and uncleanliness contribute to its production. It is
much more prevalent in temperate latitudes, where the climate is variable,
than in tropical or frigid regions. The season of the year also greatly
influences this disease, for it frequently commences in the winter and
spring, and disappears again in the summer and autumn months.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The skin should be kept clean by means of frequent
baths. These assist the functional changes which must take place on the
surface of the body, permit the stimulating influence of the light <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448"></a>[pg 448]</span>and air
and facilitate the aeration of the blood, as well as the transpiration of
fluids through the innumerable pores of the skin. All exposure to a low
temperature, especially in damp weather, and the wearing of an insufficient
amount of clothing should be avoided. Then the food should be generous and
of the most nourishing character. Steady habits and regular hours for
eating and sleep must be observed, if we would restore tone and regularity
to the functions of nutrition. Moderate exercise in the open air is
essential, in order that the blood may become well oxygenated, that the
vital changes may take place. It is no doubt true that the occasion of the
prevalence of scrofula among the lower classes may be ascribed to frequent
and severe climatic exposures, irregular and poor diet, or want of due
cleanliness. Every well-regulated family can avoid such causes and live
with a due regard to the conditions of health. The proper treatment of
scrofula is important, because we meet with its symptoms on every side,
showing its slow actions upon different parts of the body and its influence
upon all the organs. After this disease has been existing for an indefinite
length of time, certain glands enlarge, slowly inflame, finally suppurate,
and are very difficult to heal. These sores are very liable to degenerate
into ulcers. All of these symptoms point to a peculiar taste of the blood,
which continually feeds and strengthens this morbid outbreak. All authors
agree that the blood is not rich in fibrinous elements, but tends to
feebleness and slow inflammation, which ends in maturation. Thus we may
trace back this low and morbid condition of the blood to debility of the
nutritive organs, defective digestion, which may be induced by irregular
habits, a lack of nourishing food, or by the acquirement of some venereal
taint.</p>

<p>The matter that is discharged from these glands is not healthy, but is
thin, serous, and acrid; a whey-like fluid containing little fragments of
tuberculous matter, which resembles curd. The affected glands ulcerate,
look blue and indolent, and manifest no disposition to heal. We have thus
traced this disorder back to weak, perverted and faulty nutrition, to
disordered and vitiated blood, the products of which slowly inflame the
glands, which strain out unhealthy, irritating, poisonous matter. The
medicines to remedy this perverted condition of the blood and fluids must
be alteratives which will act upon the digestive organs and tone the
nutritive functions, thus enriching and purifying the blood. As this
affection is frequently a complication in chronic diseases, it is eminently
proper for us to refer to a few considerations involved in its general
treatment.</p>

<p>An alterative medicine belongs to a class which is considered capable of
producing a salutary change in a disease without exciting any sensible
evacuation. In scrofula, remedies should be employed which will improve
digestion and also prevent certain morbid operations in the blood.</p>

<p>It is well known to medical men that nearly all medicines belonging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449"></a>[pg
449]</span>to the class of alteratives, are capable of solution in the
gastric and intestinal secretions, and pass without material change, by the
process of absorption, through the coats of the stomach and intestines, as
do all liquids, and so gain an entrance into the general circulation; that
these same alteratives act locally to tone and strengthen the mucous
surfaces, and thus promote and rectify the process of digestion before
being absorbed; that alterative medicines, when in the blood, must permeate
the mass of the circulation, and thus reach the remote parts of the body
and influence every function; that these medicines, while in the blood, may
combine with it, reconstruct it, and arrest its morbid tendencies to
decomposition.</p>

<p>We should use those alteratives which give tone to the digestive and
nutritive functions, in order to curtail the constant propagation of
scrofula in the system; which alter and purify the blood through the
natural functions, thus reconstructing it; and which check the septic,
<i>disorganizing</i> changes which are evinced by the irritating and
poisonous matter discharged from the ulcers.</p>

<p>These are the three ways in which medicines operate upon the nutritive
functions and the blood.</p>

<p>Thus alteratives may be specifics, in so far as they are particularly
useful in certain disorders, and the combination which has been made in Dr.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, excels all others with which we are
acquainted, for scrofulous diseases, particularly in fulfilling the
foregoing indications. It works out peculiar processes in the blood, not
like food, by supplying merely a natural want, but by strengthening the
nutritive functions and counteracting morbid action, after which operations
it passes out of the system by excretion.</p>

<p>From what has been said upon the importance of blood medicines and their
modes of action, the reader must not infer that we account for all diseases
by some fault of the humors of the body, for we do not. But that scrofula,
in its varied forms, results from imperfect nutrition and disorders of the
blood, is now universally conceded. It is for this reason that neither time
nor pains have been spared in perfecting an alterative, tonic, nutritive,
restorative, and antiseptic compound, to which Dr. Pierce has given the
name of "Golden Medical Discovery." Not only is it an alterative and a
nutritive restorative, acting upon the secretions, but it opposes
putrefaction and degenerative decay of the fluids and solids. Hence its
universal indication in all scrofulous diseases. It will intercept those
thin, watery discharges which are the result of weakness, degeneration, and
putrescent decay of the blood, perpetuated by a low grade of scrofulous
inflammation. By an adult it can be taken in doses of from one to two
teaspoonfuls three or four times per day.</p>

<p>The bowels should be properly regulated. When constipation exists one or
two of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets taken daily, will fulfill the
indication. The patient ought not to neglect to carry out all the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450"></a>[pg
450]</span>hygienic recommendations heretofore given. The treatment of
running sores is very simple. Cleanse them every day with Castile-soap and
water, being careful not to rub or touch the surface of the sores. Use a
clean sponge or a piece of clean muslin and saturating it with the warm
water, hold it a few inches above the affected part, and squeeze out the
fluid, allowing the cleansing stream to fall gently upon the open sore.
After thoroughly cleansing the sore, apply to it Dr. Pierce's All-Healing
Salve. 25 cents in postage stamps sent to us will secure a box by return
post if your druggist does not have it in stock.</p>


<h4>HIP-JOINT DISEASE.</h4>

<h5>(COXALGIA.)</h5>


<p><i>Hip-joint disease</i>, also known as Coxalgia, is frequently a
scrofulous affection of the hip-joint. It usually attacks children, but may
occur at any period of life. The causes of this affection are imperfectly
understood, yet all the indications point to a scrofulous state of the
system. Dampness, cold, improper diet, severe injuries from blows or falls
are all numbered among the exciting causes which are conducive to the
establishment of this disease.</p>

<p><b>The Symptoms</b> are usually developed gradually; at first there is
severe pain in the knee, but finally it is located in the hip-joint.
Occasionally it is noticed in the hip and knee at the same time. As the
disease progresses, the general health becomes impaired, there is wasting
of the muscles, wakefulness, disturbed sleep, high fever, profuse and
offensive perspiration, the hair falls out, and there is an inability to
move the limb without producing excruciating pain. Frequently pus will be
formed and discharged at different points, and the limb will become greatly
emaciated. Since pain in the knee-joint may mislead as to the location of
the disease, to determine the seat of the affection, place the patient in a
chair and percuss the knee lightly, by giving it a slight blow with the
knuckle; if the hip be affected, the pain will be readily felt in that
joint; if it be simply neuralgia of the knee-joint, it will excite no pain
whatever. If the disease be allowed to progress and dislocation of the
joint takes place, the affected limb becomes shortened.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The treatment of this disease should consist in rest
for the hip-joint, cleanliness of the person and plenty of fresh air and
light, a nutritious diet and the use of tonics and sustaining alterative,
or blood-cleansing medicines. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery has,
unaided by other medicines, cured many cases of this disease. This class of
medicines should be persistently employed, in order to obtain their full
effects. It is a disease which progresses slowly and which is not easily
turned from its course, and its fatality should warn the afflicted to
employ the best treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451"></a>[pg
451]</span>Many poor, unfortunate victims know too well, from sad
experience, that the course of treatment frequently recommended and
employed by physicians and surgeons is ineffectual, and cruel; they deplete
the system, apply locally liniments, lotions, iodine, and hot applications;
confine the patient in bed and strap his hips down immovably, thus
preventing all exercise; then they attach that cruel instrument of torture,
the weight and pulley, to the diseased limb.</p>

<p>After many years of practical experience in the treatment of hundreds of
cases, we have developed a system of treatment for this terrible malady
which is based upon common sense. Instead of depleting, we, by proper
constitutional treatment, strengthen and fortify the system. We do not
confine the patient in bed, but permit him to go around and take all
necessary exercise. We adjust an ingeniously devised and perfectly fitting
appliance or apparatus, by which a gentle extension of the limb is
maintained, thereby relieving the tension of the muscles, and preventing
the friction and wearing of the inflamed surfaces of the joint, which,
without the use of our new and improved appliance, are a source of constant
irritation. The appliances required in the successful treatment of this
disease are numerous and varied in their construction, and require skill
and experience on the part of the surgical mechanic as well as on the part
of the surgeon, to take accurate and proper measurements of the diseased
limb, and to construct the appliances so that they will be adapted to the
various requirements of different cases. There are no definite rules for
taking these measurements, and only a thorough examination of the case can
indicate to the eye of the experienced surgeon what measurements are
required, and what kind of an appliance is suitable for each individual
case. At the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute these measurements are
all taken by the surgeon in person, and each appliance is constructed under
his immediate supervision. It is utterly impossible for physicians who have
but a limited experience in the treatment of such cases to take correct
measurements and send off for an apparatus which fulfills the requirements
of the case.</p>

<p>In the light of our vast experience at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute, we feel that we cannot too strongly urge the employment of a
suitable apparatus for supporting the hip-joint, giving it perfect rest,
and enabling the patient to exercise and get the outdoor air. As much of
the pain in this disease is due to the pressure of the head of the
<i>femur</i>, or thigh-bone, in the <i>acetabulum</i>, or socket,
steadily-applied mechanical extension, to relieve the inflamed and
sensitive joint of the pressure, is of the greatest importance. By such
application the patient is enabled to move about without pain, while the
joint is kept perfectly at rest&mdash;a condition favorable to the reduction of
inflammation within it. The surgeon specialist of the Invalids' Hotel and
Surgical Institute is frequently sent for to visit cases of this disease
hundreds of miles away and by the employment of suitable apparatus <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452"></a>[pg 452]</span>he has
been enabled, in scores of cases, to relieve the suffering at once. In
cases in which the head of the thigh bone, or the bony socket of the joint
has become so diseased as to cause it to ulcerate and break down, all
portions of diseased bone should be <i>thoroughly removed</i> by a surgical
operation. If this be neglected or delayed, a fatal termination of the
disease may be expected. Parents should not put off the employment of a
competent specialist in this terrible, distressing, and fatal disease. As
treated by general practitioners, it very often proves fatal; or, after
causing intense suffering for a series of years, if the active condition of
the disease subsides, the patient is left with a ruined and broken
constitution, a result which more prompt and earlier relief would have
prevented.</p>

<p>The records of practice at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute
abound in reports of cases, demonstrating the fact, that by careful and
judicious management, hip-joint disease in its earlier stages, may be
promptly arrested, and that cures may be effected even when the bony
structure of the joint is seriously diseased.</p>


<h4>WHITE SWELLING</h4>


<p>White Swelling, otherwise known as <i>Hydrarthrus</i>, or
<i>Synovitis</i>, more frequently affects the knee-joint than any other
part. The joints of the elbow, wrist, ankle, or toes, may, however, be
affected with this disease, but we shall speak of it in this connection as
affecting only the knee-joint. Synovitis may be acute or chronic. The
latter form is sometimes induced by blows, sprains, falls, etc., or from
exposure to cold; more frequently it is the result of rheumatism or
scrofula.</p>

<p><b>The Symptoms</b> of this affection are generally slow in their
appearance, being sometimes months in manifesting themselves. The joint at
first presents only a slight degree of swelling, which gradually increases.
Pain is soon felt, mild at first, but augmenting until it becomes severe.
The skin has a smooth, glistening appearance, and there is an increased
amount of heat in the parts. The affected limb becomes wasted, and is
sometimes permanently flexed. There is more or less fever about the body,
impairment of the digestive organs, and sleeplessness. The pulse is low but
quick, and night-sweats and diarrhea often appear. Under this irritation,
the patient is liable to waste away and finally die.</p>

<p>A <i>post-mortem</i> examination reveals the effects of the disease upon
the parts attacked. The cartilages of the joint are soft, the synovial
membrane is thickened, the ligaments are inflamed and often destroyed, the
synovial fluid is increased in amount, sometimes normal in appearance, at
others thick and viscous. If the bones be diseased, their articular
extremities may be distended and fatty matter deposited in them. The
conditions depend upon the form, severity, and duration of the disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453"></a>[pg
453]</span>Synovitis may be considered under three heads; Rheumatic,
Scrofulous, and Syphilitic.</p>

<p><i>Rheumatic Synovitis</i> may arise from exposure to cold, from some
injury, or from intemperance in eating. The beginning of the disease may be
distinctly marked, or it may come on so gradually that the time of its
commencement cannot be noted. The pain is of a dull, steady character, and
less severe in the night. This form of the disease sometimes terminates
favorably, but in scrofulous systems it is liable to end in the destruction
of the joint. It is more common in early life, rarely occurring after the
thirtieth year.</p>

<p><i>Scrofulous Synovitis</i>, or <i>Tuberculosis of the Knee-joint</i>,
when of a chronic character, shows a wasting of the limb, and the swelling
is of a pulpy consistence. This form of the disease is more liable to occur
in children, though occasionally it is met with in adults. But little pain
accompanies this form, although the limb is liable to become permanently
affected. In its earlier stages this disease may be checked.</p>

<p><i>Syphilitic Synovitis</i> is the result of syphilis. The pain is more
severe during the night. It, however, generally terminates unfavorably,
especially in scrofulous constitutions.</p>

<p><b>The Treatment</b> of white swelling should be both constitutional and
local. Alterative medicines are indicated to purify the blood. Doctor
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery is unequaled for this purpose.</p>

<p>As local treatment, in the active stage of the disease, the knee-joint
should be steamed, and hot fomentations applied. This should be followed by
applications over the joint of solid extract of stramonium or belladonna,
mixed with glycerine. The joint should be wrapped in cotton or wool to keep
it uniformly warm. If there are openings about the joint, discharging pus,
syringe them out once a day with Castile soap-suds, which may be improved
by adding a little bicarbonate of potash (common saleratus). See that the
bowels are kept regular, and that the diet is nourishing.</p>

<p>Cases of this disease which have been treated at the Invalids' Hotel and
Surgical Institute with uniform success might be cited to the extent of
filling a very large number of pages like these. When treated by a skilled
specialist, this otherwise formidable and dangerous disease is readily
amenable to treatment, and good and serviceable limbs can be promised, even
in the extreme cases in which amputation is usually advised by general
practitioners and surgeons, who desire the glory that they imagine they
will receive by performing a capital operation.</p>


<h4>RICKETS. (RACHITIS.)</h4>


<p>Rickets is a scrofulous disease, in which there is derangement of the
entire system, and it finally manifests itself in disease of the bones. It
is characterized by a softening of the bony tissue, due to a deficiency of
earthy or calcareous matter in their composition. It appears to be <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454"></a>[pg 454]</span>a
disease incident to cold, damp places, ill-lighted and imperfectly
ventilated rooms, and it especially attacks those who are uncleanly in
their habits.</p>

<p><b>The Symptoms</b> of rickets are severe pains in the bones, especially
during the night, febrile excitement and profuse perspiration, paleness of
the face, a sallow and wrinkled appearance of the skin, and derangement of
the digestive organs. After a time the body becomes emaciated, the face
pale, and the head unusually large. The bones become soft and unable to
support the body; various distortions appear; the extremities of the long
bones are enlarged, while the limbs between the joints are very slender.
Rickets is a disease peculiar to childhood, though it may not be developed
until a more advanced period of life. It rarely proves fatal, unless the
lungs, heart, or other vital organs, become involved. In some instances the
softening and other symptoms continue to increase until every function is
affected, and death ensues.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem</i> examinations of those who have died of rickets have
disclosed morbid changes in the brain, liver, and lymphatic glands. The
lungs are often compressed or displaced, and the muscles of the body become
pale and wasted. Sometimes the bones are so soft, on account of the
deficiency of the calcareous deposit, that they can be easily cut with a
knife.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery is
indicated in this affection. It is a disease usually developed during
childhood, in consequence of insufficient exercise, deprivation of the
sunlight, low, innutritious diet, and lack of cleanliness. Therefore, it is
essential to obviate all known causes, and, at the same time supply the
patient with food rich in those elements which the system seems to demand.
Under any plan of treatment the general directions given for the hygienic
management of scrofula should be followed. We might cite many cases that
have entirely recovered from this disease, under our advice and the use of
"Golden Medical Discovery." We shall merely say, for the encouragement of
the afflicted, that this form of scrofula yields readily to this
medicine.</p>


<h4>OLD SORES. (CHRONIC ULCERS.)</h4>


<p>Under this head we may properly consider that class of affections known
as Fever-sores, Running-sores, Ulcers, etc. These sores have common
characteristics, yet each possesses certain peculiarities, which have led
to their division into <i>irritable, indolent</i>, and <i>varicose</i>.
These peculiarities are not constant, one form of ulcer often changing into
another. One feature common to all, however, is their slowness in healing,
which has sometimes led to the belief that they are incurable. Another
popular notion is that their cure is detrimental to the health of the
patient. With equal propriety we might say that it is dangerous to cure
diarrhea, dysentery, consumption, or cancer. As a result of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a>[pg 455]</span>these
erroneous impressions, many people suffer from chronic ulcers for years,
and even for a life-time, without attempting to obtain relief. Chronic
ulcers usually appear upon the lower extremities. The depth and appearance
of the ulcer depend upon its character and the thickness of the tissues
where it is situated. Fig. 2 shows a chronic ulcer, or fever-sore, as it
appears upon the ankle.</p>

<p><b>The Irritable Ulcer</b> is painful and tender, the slightest injury
causing it to bleed. It is of a dark purplish hue, and filled with spongy,
sensitive granulations. It discharges a thin, bloody matter which is
sometimes very fetid and acrid, and excoriates the tissues if it comes in
contact with them. The edges of this species of ulcer are shelf-like and
ragged, and turn inward. The adjacent structures are red and swollen. Very
often they are attended by severe constitutional disturbances, such as
chills, fever, and great nervous prostration and irritability.</p>

<p><b>In the Indolent Ulcer</b> the edges are not undermined, but turned
outward, and are rounded, thick, glossy, and regular. The granulations are
broad, flat, pale, insensible, and covered with a grayish, tenacious
matter. The surrounding parts are not very sensitive, but the limb on which
it is located is apt to be swollen. This is the commonest form of ulcer,
and often remains for years.</p>

<p><b>Varicose Ulcer.</b> This species of ulcer occasions a swollen or
enlarged condition of the neighboring veins, which are very much enfeebled.
It almost invariably appears below the knee, and may be either indolent or
irritable. It is generally sensitive to the touch, and sometimes
excessively painful. Knots of superficial veins may often be seen beneath
the skin.</p>

<p>As we have before remarked, these various species of ulcers are merely
modifications of one form of chronic sore. The patient may assert that he
enjoys excellent health, but if we question him closely, we find that the
sore irritates him, and that there is sufficient constitutional disturbance
to prevent the healing powers of nature from effecting a cure.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The cure of these sores is necessarily slow, and who
ever expects to obtain <i>immediate</i> relief will be disappointed.</p>

<p>Constitutional treatment is of the utmost importance, and should,
therefore, be thoroughly and persistently applied. The nutritive <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456"></a>[pg 456]</span>system,
especially the absorbents, should be kept active, as these are the channels
by which the broken-down tissue surrounding the sore is replaced by that of
a higher grade of vitality. For this purpose, the best alteratives or blood
cleansing remedies are required. If secretion and excretion are not
normally performed, the blood becomes poisoned by the absorption of
unhealthy "matter" from the sore, and various constitutional disturbances
occur. If, at any time during treatment, constitutional disturbances are
manifested by fullness or disagreeable sensations in the head, nausea,
pain, cough, chills, or fever, a thorough cathartic should be given. If the
patient be robust, a repetition of the same once a week will be very
beneficial. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, and "Pellets" will be
productive of the best results.</p>

<p>The local treatment should depend upon the character of the ulcer. If
the sore be <i>irritable</i> or painful, soothing applications, such as
warm poultices or steaming in a vapor of bitter herbs, as hops, boneset or
smart-weed or water pepper, will be found highly beneficial. A poultice of
powdered slippery elm is also very soothing, and hence well adapted to this
purpose. If the ulcer be <i>indolent</i>, a stimulating application is
necessary. The hardened, callous state of the edges should be removed by
alkaline applications. A strong solution of saleratus, or even a caustic,
prepared by boiling the lye from hard-wood ashes to the consistence of
syrup, will prove of great utility. One or two applications of the latter
are generally sufficient.</p>

<p>The foregoing course of treatment is intended to put the open sore or
ulcer in what is known to surgeons as a healthy condition&mdash;a condition most
favorable for the healing process.</p>

<p>But the open surface of the sore needs something more. It needs the
cleansing or antiseptic and soothing influence of such a dressing as is
found in Dr. Pierce's All-Healing Salve. If your dealer in medicines does
not have this Salve in stock, 25 cents in stamps sent to World's Dispensary
Medical Association, Buffalo, N.Y., will secure a box of this unequaled
dressing. It will be sent to your address by return post. Therefore, do not
allow the dealer to put you off with some inferior preparation. If he has
not the All-Healing Salve in stock you can easily obtain it by sending to
us as above directed.</p>

<p>No matter how good the local dressing applied to the open sore, or
ulcer, do not discontinue the internal use of the "Golden Medical
Discovery" until the affected parts are completely healed.</p>


<h4>FEVER-SORE. (NECROSIS.)</h4>


<p>By the term <i>necrosis</i> we mean mortification, or the state of a
bone when it is deprived of life. Dunglison says: "This condition is to the
bone what <i>gangrene</i> is to the soft parts." It is popularly known as
<i>fever-sore</i>, there being no distinction made between this species of
sore and those ulcers which affect only the soft tissues of the body. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457"></a>[pg
457]</span>any part of a bone becomes <i>necrosed</i>, it is treated as a
foreign body. Nature makes an effort for its removal, and at the same time
attempts to replace it with new and healthy materials. In consequence of
this process, the dead portion is often inclosed in a case of new, sound
bone, termed the <i>involucrum</i>; when this is the case the dead portion
is termed the <i>sequestrum</i>. If, however, it be superficial, and
separate from the parts beneath, it is called an <i>exfoliation</i>. This
healing process, by which the involucrum is formed, cannot be completed
while the dead portion remains. Hence, numerous openings are made through
the involucrum, to permit the escape of the sequestrum. When a surgical
operation is performed for the removal of the necrosed bone it is called
<i>sequestrotomy</i>. The instruments which our specialists usually employ
for this practice are represented in Figs. 3, 4, and 5.</p>

/></a><br />Fig. 5. Gouge forceps for excavating bone.</p>

<p><b>Causes.</b> Fever-sore may be due to inflammation, injuries, working
in phosphorus, or from the inordinate and protracted use of mercury.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The pain frequently commences in the night, and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458"></a>[pg
458]</span>the different stages succeed, until, finally, the result is
frequently mortification or death. The entire bone, or only a part of it,
may be affected; the parts become swollen, "matter" forms, and unless it be
artificially evacuated, it will in time work its way out through a
fistulous opening. As the disease progresses, the adjacent tissues become
thickened and numerous openings are formed, which communicate with the
bone, and often with each other, so that a probe may be passed from one to
another, as represented in Fig. 6, copied from a drawing by Dr. Howe. The
discharge from fever-sores varies in character, and usually has a fetid
odor. The surgeon can readily distinguish between healthy and unhealthy
bone by the use of a probe. The pus discharged in necrosis contains minute
particles of bone, which may be felt by rubbing it between the fingers.
Sometimes large pieces present themselves at the openings. The general
health is seriously impaired, and the patient becomes debilitated,
an&aelig;mic, and hectic.</p>

Necrosis of the tibia. A common probe is passed through the sinuses, or
openings.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The process of repair is necessarily tedious, and
nature should be assisted to remove the old bone and promote the formation
of the new. An alterative course of treatment is indicated and must be
persistently followed. Give Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and
Pleasant Pellets in sufficient doses to keep the bowels regular. However,
all efforts to heal the sores, as long as dead bone remains, will prove
fruitless. The sores should he throughly cleansed with injections of an
alkaline solution, after which bandages, moistened with glycerine, may be
applied. If they emit a fetid odor, add a few drops of carbolic acid to the
glycerine. The dead bone can be but slowly removed by suppuration,
therefore time, and, indeed, sometimes life itself, may be saved by
removing it with surgical instruments. In the operation of sequestrotomy,
the surgeon must exercise great judgment. Carelessness may prolong the
disease and subsequently necessitate another operation, or, perhaps, an
amputation.</p>

<p>Usually the dead bone is easily removed by the skilled specialist
surgeon, and, when thoroughly taken out, the parts readily heal and the
patient rapidly recovers. The removal, therefore, of the dead bone which is
a constant source of irritation, and the cause of protracted suffering,
should not be delayed, for very rarely indeed can it be removed at all
without the assistance of the surgeon. Besides, delay often results in the
loss of the limb, and not unfrequently occasions <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_459" id="Page_459"></a>[pg 459]</span>the death of the patient.
Under the influence of a reliable local <i>an&aelig;sthetic</i>, carefully
applied, the operation of removing the decayed and offensive bone is
speedily and painlessly performed, the use of chloroform or ether not
generally being required.</p>

<h4>A TERRIBLE SKIN DISEASE.</h4>

<p>Jackson, N.C.</p>

<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:</p>

<p><i>Dear Sirs</i>&mdash;I had been troubled with skin disease all my life. As
I grew older the disease seemed to be taking a stronger hold upon me. I
tried many advertised remedies with no benefit, until I was led to try your
"Golden Medical Discovery." When I began taking it my health was very poor;
in fact, several persons have since told me that they thought I had the
consumption. I weighed only about 125 pounds. The eruption on my skin was
accompanied by severe itching. It was first confined to my face, but
afterwards spread over the neck and head, and the itching became <i>simply
unbearable</i>. This was my condition when I began taking the "Discovery."
When I would rub the parts affected a kind of branny scale would fall
off.</p>

<p>For a while I saw no change or benefit from taking the "Discovery," but
I persisted in its use, keeping my bowels open by taking the "Pellets," and
taking as much outdoor exercise as was possible, until I begun to gain in
flesh, and gradually the disease released its hold. I took during the year
somewhere from fifteen to eighteen bottles of the "Discovery." It has now
been four years since I first used it, and though not using scarcely any
since the first year, my health continues good. My average weight being 155
to 160 pounds, instead of 125, as it was when I began the use of the
"Discovery."</p>

<p>Many persons have reminded me of my improved appearance. Some say I look
younger than I did six years ago when I was married. I am now forty-eight
(48) years old, and stronger, and enjoy better health than I have ever done
before in my life. Yours truly,</p>

as well as ever.</p>

<p>I was six weeks under treatment at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute, and I got first-class accommodation.</p>

<p>The case was a strange one. The pimples did not break out on my chin
where I had let my beard grow, they broke out on my cheeks, forehead and
nose. A doctor in San Francisco told me it was blood poison and said it was
very hard to cure it. I think if it were blood poison it would run all
through my system. When I first felt the disease coming on in winter&mdash;my
face used to be very cold. I worked under the sun fourteen years every
summer. I wore no hat&mdash;nothing but a skull cap. I thought I was sun-proof.
The doctor in San Francisco stopped the disease for one year but it came
back again. I had it for five years. It came on from hard work and exposure
in the sun.</p>

<p>When my face would break out in the fall it got so itchy, and then
little pimples would break out on my face, nose and forehead. I think
parasites were in my face. If I would drink a glass of beer, I would feel
the effects of it in my face, and tobacco would affect me just the same. My
face, nose and forehead would be spotted all over like a "fiddler's note
book," every fall for five years. I never saw a case like mine. The doctor
said if I would get tanned with the sun I would be all right.</p>

five bottles and I have used it since for other troubles. It has helped me
wonderfully, in fact cured me, and I recommend it to all my friends.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;My baby when about three months old began to have
little sores come out on his face; did not amount to much until six months
old, then they began to spread all over his face and head until his face,
head and ears were one solid sore. Our family physician was summoned at the
early stages of the disease and tried everything he knew of for the cure of
the same, but nothing did him any good. The disease baffled the skill of
the doctor in every way, and I was advised by friends to try certain
remedies, which I did, with very little effect. The child by this time was
a heart-rendering sight to behold, and suffered unknown agonies with the
torturing itching and burning of the sores, and so things ran on until my
brother, who resides in Buffalo, visited me. As soon as he saw the child he
advised me to have him treated at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute in Buffalo. I wrote to them stating my baby's case, asking them
if they could help him, and they thought they could, so began their
treatment at once by using salves externally and medicine internally and as
soon as they began their treatment the child began to improve and continued
so until he was entirely cured in six months' time. He is now two years and
six months old and is as tough as any child you ever saw; weighs
thirty-five pounds and is perfectly well, thanks to Dr. Pierce and his
wonderful medicines.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;About four years ago I took scrofula, and did
everything that doctors and others prescribed, but only got worse. Several
abscesses formed about my neck and breast, discharging a quantity of
matter. I got so weak I could scarcely walk about the house. I read all the
medical works I could get hold of, and, among the rest, read some of your
works. You described my case, and recommended Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery with his "Pleasant Pellets." So I procured some and commenced
using them and soon began to mend. In six months my sores were all healed
up, and in twelve months <i>I was entirely well</i>. I am forty-five years
old and believe I am as stout as I ever was in my life. I used about one
dozen bottles of the "Golden Medical Discovery" with the "Pellets," and
used nothing else after I began using your medicines. So I must give your
medicine all the praise for curing me, and I am bound to recommend it.</p>

washed open the corruption would run down my face and drop off. I have
tried all of our physicians and their medicine did me no good. A physician
attended them from Ellicott City and did them no good. He said it was the
running scrofula in the eyelids and could never be cured; it had continued
fourteen years, and I had given up all hopes of ever being cured until I
saw your advertisement of the "People's Common Sense Medical Adviser," and
I sent and got one, and I saw a great deal in it about the eyes. I wrote to

<p>DR. R.V. PIERCE: <i>Dear Sir</i>&mdash;When about three years old I was taken
with mumps, also had fever, finally I had that dreaded disease Scrofula.
The most eminent physicians in this section treated me to no avail. I had
running scrofulous sores on left side of neck and face. I was small and
weakly when eight or nine years old, and in fact was nearly a skeleton. Six
bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery wrought marvelous changes.
Although the sores were healed in eight months, I did not quit taking it
until I was sure it had been entirely routed from my system. The only signs
left of the dreadful disease are the scars which ever remind me of how near
death's door I was until rescued by the "Discovery." I am now eighteen
years old and weigh 148 pounds; and have not been sick in five years.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;My daughter who is now 18 years of age was attacked
with a severe pain and swelling in her ankle, which soon caused her to have
high fever. We employed some of the best physicians in this locality who
pronounced it rheumatism, did everything for her they could do, but she
kept getting worse from day to day, and in about five weeks after she was
first taken sick her ankles and legs came open and discharged a lot of
yellow matter and finally slivers of bones came out of the openings in her
ankles. All the doctors we consulted said that we would have to have an
operation performed on her and have the dead bones taken out, or else she
could not get well, with the exception of one of the doctors who said that
if her health could be improved the dead bones would come out and be
replaced with new ones, for the dead pieces would brake loose from the
sound bone and come out through the opening with the matter; but he could
not do anything to improve her health.</p>

<p>After doctoring her three months she was reduced to a mere skeleton and
had to be tended to like a mere baby and have her feet elevated, or else
she would scream with pain. We commenced giving her Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery. After using it for one month we could see, for the first
time, that she was getting no worse, and after using about five bottles her
health began to improve a little; but she still suffered with pain and
could not have her feet down until she had taken twelve bottles. When she
had taken fifteen bottles&mdash;she began to walk on crutches, and later with a
cane, for about two or three months, when she could walk without a crutch
or cane. The diseased bones gradually came out in pieces, some of them an
inch to two inches long and one-fourth of an inch thick; the sores healed
as soon as the last dead bone was out. She is now a strong healthy young
lady as her photograph plainly shows.</p>

eat anything. My husband got me "sarsaparillas" and "cures" and "bitters,"
and nothing did me any good. Finally he got two bottles of Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery. I began using it, and, thank God and you, I
improved; now I weigh 140 pounds, and my skin is as smooth as a baby's. My

limbs but the use of liniment and Dr. Pierce's Pellets relieved her, and
she got better. When six years old the trouble developed into hip-joint
disease, so pronounced by her physician. She lost the use of the limb. Was
three months under the doctors, but got no better. She complained of great
pain in the limb, especially in the knee and hip. The limb wasted away,
becoming small and short, and her back became crooked. She had no appetite;
was very weak. Hip and knee were very tender to the touch. Physician's
treatment not helping her, her mother began to give her "Golden Medical
Discovery." Four months afterwards she wrote Dr. Pierce as follows: "She is
growing fast, and never complains of any pain or ache. She sleeps well, and
eats heartily. Her leg has filled up, and is as big as the other. She plays
around all day with the other children. Everybody is astonished to see how
she has improved."</p>

good. Had six or seven carbuncles at a time, as large as a hen's egg; he
got so weak and suffered so much he could not walk a step. It was in the
summer of '72 or '73 that he had his bed put in the middle of his chamber
and got on it to die. No one expected him to get well. Looking over the
newspapers, he saw your "Golden Medical Discovery" advertised, and the good
it had done. There was not any sold then in the country, so he sent to
Richmond&mdash;forty-five miles&mdash;and got a bottle. When he began to take it he
was nearly covered with carbuncles&mdash;little and big together. Before he had

he was entirely cured, and he has never been bothered with them since.

<h4>THICK NECK. (GOITRE.)</h4>

<p>Thick neck, or goitre, also sometimes called bronchocele, consists of an
enlargement of the thyroid gland, which lies over and on each side of the
trachea, or windpipe, between the prominence known as "Adam's apple" and
the breast bone. The tumor gradually increases in front and laterally,
until it produces great deformity, and often interferes with respiration
and the act of swallowing. From its pressure on the great blood-vessels
running to and from the head, there is a constant liability to engorgement
of blood in the brain, and to apoplexy, epilepsy, etc. When the enlargement
once makes its appearance, it continues to increase in size as long as the
person lives, unless appropriate treatment be resorted to. It never
disappears spontaneously. These tumors are much larger than those not
familiar with them would suppose from their outward appearance, as they
extend under and are bound down by the muscles on each side of the neck, so
that they become embedded in the cellular tissues underneath, while the
sides of the neck retain, to a considerable extent, their round and even
appearance, whereby the real magnitude of the tumor is not apparent. Figure
7 represents the appearance of the neck of a person afflicted with this
disease. The form of protuberance varies materially with different persons,
that shown in the engraving being the shape which it ordinarily
assumes.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise167"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 7." src="images/advise167.png" /></a><br />Fig. 7.</p>

<p>The causes of the affection are not well understood. The use of
snow-water, or water impregnated with some particular saline or calcareous
matter, has been assigned as a cause. It has also been attributed to the
use of water in which there is not a trace of iron, iodine, or bromine. A
writer in a Swiss journal, <i>Feuilles d' Hygiene</i>, states that the
disease is often due to an impeded circulation in the large veins of the
neck, from pressure of the clothing, or from the head being bent forward, a
position which is often seen in school children, when the muscles of the
back of the neck have become fatigued.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. We have obtained wonderful results by a new method of
treatment, which consists in the employment of electrolysis in conjunction
with other therapeutic means. There is scarcely a case in which this
treatment, properly carried out, will not effect a radical cure. It is
attended with no danger whatever.</p>

<p>Those who are afflicted with this disease and unable to avail themselves
of special treatment, cannot do better than to take Dr. Pierce's Alterative
Extract, or Golden Medical Discovery, and apply to the skin over and around
the tumor, night and morning the following solution which may be prepared
at any drug store: iodine, one <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471"
id="Page_471"></a>[pg 471]</span>drachm; iodide of potassium, four drachms;
dissolve in three ounces of soft water. Apply to the tumor twice a day,

<p>This is an inflammation of the parotid glands and generally occurs in
childhood. It is often epidemic, and is manifestly contagious. It usually,
though not always, appears on both sides of the neck at the same time.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. An external, movable swelling, just below and in front
of the ear, near the angle of the jaw, is the prominent symptom. The
enlargement is not circumscribed, but hard and painful, and attended with
more or less fever, derangement of the secretions, and difficulty in
swallowing. The swelling increases until the fourth and fifth day, when it
gradually diminishes, and by the eighth or tenth is entirely gone.
Sometimes the disease is accompanied by swelling of the breasts in the
female, or the testicles in the male.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. Usually but little treatment is necessary. Exposure to
cold should be avoided. If severe or painful, with febrile symptoms, a hot
foot-bath and small doses of the "Compound Extract of Smart-Weed," in some
diaphoretic infusion, to induce sweating, together with small doses of
aconite, will produce good results. If swelling of the testicles threatens
(which seldom happens except on taking cold), resort should be had to mild
cathartics, the spirit vapor-bath, stimulating liniments to the neck, and
warm fomentations to the part attacked If delirium occurs, a physician
should be summoned.</p>


<h4>INFLUENZA, OR LA GRIPPE.</h4>


<p>This is an infectious disease, characterized by depression, and usually
associated with a catarrhal condition of the mucous membrane. It may affect
the respiratory organs or the intestinal canal. There is a marked liability
to serious complications, of which pneumonia is the most dangerous. The
disease is evidently due to a specific virus of great infectiveness, and is
more active and contagious at certain seasons and under certain conditions
of the atmosphere. By some it has been supposed that it is due to a miasma
in the air, but the character of its infection indicates that the true
virus is of a germinal nature.</p>

<p>Uncomplicated cases recover, but in the aged and in the delicate we may
see fatal results, due usually to the profound depression or the high
temperature to which the individual is subjected. There is much redness and
swelling of the mucous membranes of the nose and throat&mdash;a bronchitis&mdash;and
a catarrhal state of the stomach and intestines. These may all be present,
or the disease may center upon one particular portion of the animal
economy, and manifest its ravages there alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472"></a>[pg
472]</span><b>Symptoms</b>. The attack usually resembles an ordinary
catarrh of cold. In some cases the nasal catarrh is absent, or very mild,
and the infection invades the general system, with much fever. A very
striking manifestation of the disease is the severe nervous troubles which
are present at the outset, consisting of headache, pain in the back and
legs, and a general soreness of the muscles and bones as if bruised or
beaten. The pulse is usually feeble and small&mdash;intermittent. The disease
may center in the brain, producing delirium. Mental disorders are not
uncommon, and there is usually following the disease more or less
inaptitude for mental work and a tendency to depression of spirits. In many
cases there is a severe diarrhea, and the individual suffers much from pain
and discomfort in the abdomen. This is a gastro-intestinal irritation, and
apparently favors an early recovery, and usually there are less severe
sequels in such cases.</p>

<p>The most dangerous complication is pneumonia. These cases may follow
bronchitis, or the grip may begin with well-characterized symptoms of this
disease, for which see the chapters upon this trouble. The sputa may not be
rusty until after several days. The crisis is usually slow, and a
considerable proportion recover, the disease frequently showing a sudden
change for the better, and the patient being up and around in a few days.
Cases complicated with pneumonia are the most indefinite in their symptoms,
and require the closest attention.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In every case the disease must be regarded as a
dangerous one, and the patient be confined to bed and indoors until all
fever has disappeared, otherwise sudden and serious manifestations are
liable to appear at any time. The patient must be well fed and nourished
from the outset. The bowels should be acted upon by mild laxatives, such as
castor oil or Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets, using from one to three. It is
also of advantage afterward to move them twice each day, by the injection
of warm water, to which has been added a teaspoonful of table salt to each
pint. This injected into the rectum, using the water slightly tepid, or
cool if the patient is feverish, will tend to soften the actions from the
bowels and favor the escape of poisonous matter. The cool water has also a
soothing effect upon the fever and nervous system. If the fever is high,
and there is delirium, small doses of aconite, with water, should be used
every half hour or hour, but all depressing agents of this kind must be
used with caution, as profound prostration sometimes develops. Warm baths,
repeated frequently, and followed by hot lemonade, are of the greatest
benefit in reducing the feverish condition and quieting the patient. The
bed should be warmed after these are administered and the patient given hot
lemonade to bring on free action of the skin, kidneys, and bowels. Where
the pulse is weak, the free use of stimulants, as wine, coffee, tea, and
brandy or whiskey, are required, as the great danger of the disease is a
depression of the heart. In severe bronchitis, pneumonia, and other
complications, appropriate treatment should be applied.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473"></a>[pg
473]</span><h2>ACUTE NASAL CATARRH.</h2>


<p>Acute Nasal Catarrh, or cold in the head, is an acute inflammation of
the mucous membrane lining the nasal passage which may confine itself to
these parts or extend to the pharynx, larynx, and air-passages below, or
affect the auxiliary sinuses or cavities communicating with the nasal
passages.</p>

<p>The most frequent cause of cold in the head is exposure to sudden
changes in temperature, or draughts of cool air, without taking proper
precaution to protect the body so as to prevent the rapid radiation of
animal heat. In most cases there is an inherited tendency or acquired
weakness, which frequently may be associated with a scrofulous condition of
the whole system, that render these points less resistant, and consequently
invite the morbid changes which result from exposure and cold. Acute
Catarrh also occurs during the initial stage of such eruptive diseases as
measles, typhus, typhoid, erysipelas, etc.</p>

<p>Seldom do we meet with an otherwise healthy individual, who is subjected
to a frequent cold in the head. Impure blood, inherited scrofulous taints,
enfeebled circulation, debility, either general or nervous, are all advance
agents, inviting catarrhal disease, and preventing rapid recovery from an
acute attack, so that a low grade of Chronic Catarrh is generally the
sequence.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The attack is visually ushered in by a chill, or chilly
sensation, feeling of lassitude, followed by a slight fever. These symptoms
are not as distressing as the sense of fullness about the eyes and frontal
region, and prickling dry heat, with more or less obstruction in the
nostrils. A few hours later follows a copious, acrid watery discharge,
which gradually becomes thick and yellow. Often the inflammatory action may
extend to the orifice of the eustachian tube, causing obstruction with
temporary deafness, or ringing in the ears. Severe facial neuralgia may be
caused by the pressure from the swollen parts upon the branches of
sensitive nerves.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In the mild forms of acute catarrh, or coryza, only
simple treatment is required. A hot foot-bath on retiring at night, with a
full dose of Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-weed, to produce free
perspiration will generally break up the attack. Should the discharge from
the nostrils continue, Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy should be freely used four
to six times each day, until the symptoms are controlled. In case the
bowels do not act, a full dose of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets may he
taken at bed-time. Avoidance of exposure to cold, and light vegetable diet,
are advisable. In the more severe attacks, especially when complicated by
laryngeal or bronchial symptoms, the most decisive measures should be
employed. The Compound Extract of Smart-weed should be taken freely,
together with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474"
id="Page_474"></a>[pg 474]</span>hot drinks, or a hot general bath. The
patient should be warmly covered in bed to encourage a continued
perspiration, to equalize the circulation, and subdue the inflammation. Dr.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery should be taken in teaspoonful doses four
times each day in all cases that are complicated or protracted.</p>

<p>Individuals suffering from frequent colds will do wisely to fortify
their systems by taking a few bottles of the "Golden Medical Discovery" to
improve nutrition, purify the blood, and thus aid nature in overcoming such
inherited tendency or required weakness as may be their misfortune to
possess. Remember frequent attacks of Acute Catarrh prepare fertile soil
for the chronic form which oftentimes is so loathsome and destructive.</p>


<h2>CHRONIC NASAL CATARRH.</h2>

<h4>OZ&AElig;NA.</h4>


<p>In consequence of repeated attacks of acute catarrh, or "cold in the
head," as it is usually termed, the mucous membranes of the nose and the
air-passages of the head become permanently thickened, the mucous follicles
or glands diseased, and their functions either destroyed or very much
deranged. Although chronic catarrh is most commonly brought on in the
manner above stated, it sometimes makes its appearance as a sequel of
typhoid fever, scarlet fever, measles, or other eruptive fevers, or shows
itself as a local manifestation of scrofulous or syphilitic taints in the
system.</p>

<p>Injury to the nose may result in a displacement of one or more of the
bony structures, setting up a chronic inflammation with catarrh at that
point. In the early stages of the disease, the patient may be annoyed with
"only a slight dropping into the throat," as many express it, the amount of
the discharges from the air-passages of the head at this stage of the
disease being only slightly in excess of health. In some cases the
discharge is thick, ropy, and tough, requiring frequent and strong efforts
in the way of blowing and spitting, to remove it from the throat, in which
it frequently lodges. In other cases, or in other stages of the same case,
the discharge is thin, watery, acrid, irritating, and profuse. The nose may
be "stopped up" from the swollen and thickened condition of the lining
mucous membrane, so as to necessitate respiration through the mouth, giving
to the voice a disagreeable nasal twang. From the nature of the obstruction
in this condition, it is useless for the sufferer to endeavor to clear the
passage by blowing the nose; this only tends to render a bad matter worse,
by increasing the irritation and swelling of the already thickened lining
membrane. The swelling of the mucous membrane does not in all cases become
so great as to cause obstruction to respiration through <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475"></a>[pg 475]</span>the
affected passages. In some cases, the patient suffers from head ache a
great portion of the time, or experiences a dull, heavy, disagreeable
fullness or pressure in the head, with a confusion of his ideas, which
renders him quite unfit for business, especially such as requires deep
thought and mental labor. Memory may be more or less affected, and the
disposition of those who are otherwise amiable is often rendered irritable
or morose and despondent. The mental faculties suffer to such an extent in
some cases as to result in insanity. The sense of smell is in many cases
impaired, and sometimes entirely lost, and the senses of taste and hearing
are not unfrequently more or less affected.</p>

<p><b>Oz&aelig;na</b>. The ulcerous or more aggravated stage of the disease,
from the offensive odor that frequently attends it, is denominated
<i>Oz&aelig;na</i>.</p>

<p>The secretion which is thrown out in the more advanced stages of chronic
catarrh becomes so acrid, unhealthy, and poisonous, that it produces severe
irritation and inflammation, which are followed by excoriation and
ulceration of the delicate membrane which lines the air-passages in the
head. Although commencing in this membrane, the ulceration is not confined
to it, but gradually extends in depth, until it frequently involves all the
component structures of the nose&mdash;cartilage and bone, as well as fibrous
tissues. As the ulceration extends up among the small bones, the discharge
generally becomes profuse and often excessively fetid, requires the
frequent use of the handkerchief, and renders the poor sufferer
disagreeable to both himself and those with whom he associates. Thick,
tough, brownish incrustations, or hardened lumps, are many times formed in
the head, by the evaporation of the watery portion of the discharge. These
lumps are sometimes so large and tough that it is with great difficulty
that they can be removed. They are usually discharged every second, fourth,
or fifth day, but only to be succeeded by another crop. Portions of
cartilage and bone, or even entire bones, often die, slough away, and are
discharged, either in large flakes, or blackened, half-decayed, and crumbly
pieces; or, as is much more commonly the case, in the form of numerous
minute particles, that escape with the discharge and are unobserved. It is
painfully unpleasant to witness the ravages of this terrible disease, and
observe the extent to which it sometimes progresses. Holes are eaten
through the roof of the mouth, and great cavities excavated into the solid
bones of the face; in such cases only the best and most through treatment
will check the progress and fatal termination of the disease.</p>


<h4>COMPLICATIONS.</h4>


<p>Catarrh, or Oz&aelig;na, is liable to be complicated, not only by the system,
blood, and fluids, suffering from scrofulous or other taints, as has
already been pointed out, but also by an extension of the diseased
conditions to other parts beyond the air-passages of the head.</p>

<p>Occasionally deformities of the septum or other internal structures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476"></a>[pg
476]</span>also polypi or tumors, are sources of constant irritation and
accelerate catarrhal disease.</p>

<p><b>Disease of the Throat</b>. The acrid, irritating and poisonous
discharge, which, in some stages of disease, almost constantly runs down
over the delicate lining membrane of the <i>pharynx</i> (throat), is liable
to produce in this sensitive membrane a diseased condition similar to that
existing in the air-passages of the head. The throat may feel dry, husky,
and at times slightly sore or raw; or, from the muco-purulent discharge
that is almost constantly dropping down over its surface, the patient may
feel very little inconvenience from the disease of the throat until it is
far advanced&mdash;the moistening and lubricating effect of the matter that
drops on the surface tending to blunt the sensibility of the parts. (<i>See
pharyngitis for symptoms and treatment</i>.)</p>

<p><b>The Extension of the Disease to the Larynx</b>. The larynx, situated
directly below the pharynx (throat), is subjected to the influence of the
same irritation from acrid and poisonous discharges dropping into the
throat from the head. More or less of it is removed by hawking and
spitting, but some remains and is drawn into the larynx, or still lower
into the trachea (windpipe), with the inspired air. Thus the disease creeps
along the continuous mucous surfaces of the air-passages, the acrid
poisonous discharge arousing in its track the irritation, inflammation,
ulceration, and thickening of the lining membrane which characterize the
disease in other portions of the air-passages. The symptoms and treatment
of laryngitis will be found under its appropriate classification.</p>

<p><b>Bronchitis and Consumption</b>. We have already detailed the manner
in which the throat, larynx, and trachea, in succession, become affected
from catarrh, or Oz&aelig;na. By the same process of extension, the bronchial
tubes, and lastly, the <i>parenchyma</i>, or substance of the lungs, in
their turn, become diseased, and bronchitis and consumption are firmly
established. Tightness in the chest, with difficulty of breathing;
soreness; darting, sharp, or dull, heavy pain, or a prickly, distressing
sensation, accompanied with more or less cough and expectoration&mdash;are
evidences that the bronchial tubes have become affected, and they should
admonish the sufferer <i>that he is now standing on the stepping-stone
to</i> CONSUMPTION, over which thousands annually tread, in their slow
journey to the grave.</p>

<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise168"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 8. Internal and external ear." src="images/advise168.png" /></a><br
/>Fig. 8. Internal and external ear. <i>1</i>, External ear. <i>2</i>, Internal auditory
meatus. <i>3</i>, Tympanum. <i>4</i>, Labyrinth. <i>5</i>, Eustachian tube.</p>

<p><b>Deafness</b>. By means of a small canal, called the <i>eustachian
tube</i>, an air-passage and communication between the throat and middle
ear is formed. (See Fig. 8.) This passage is lined by a continuation of the
mucous membrane which covers the throat and nasal passages. The catarrhal
inflammatory process, by continuity of surface, follows the mucous
membrane, thickening its structure, until the eustachian tube is closed,
and the beautiful mechanism of the internal ear is rendered useless. While
the thickening of the mucous membrane is going on, and the passage is
gradually becoming closed (and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477"
id="Page_477"></a>[pg 477]</span>the process sometimes extends through
several years), the patient will occasionally, while blowing the nose,
experience a crackling in one or both ears, and hearing becomes dull, but
returns suddenly, accompanied with a snapping sound. This may be repeated
many times, until, finally, hearing does not return, but remains
permanently injured. In other cases the hearing is lost so gradually that a
considerable degree of deafness may exist before the person is really aware
of the fact. Either condition is often accompanied with noises in the head
of every conceivable description, increasing the distress of the sufferer.
The delicate bones of the ear are sometimes detached from their
articulations, the drum is ulcerated and perforated, and through the
orifice thus made, the bones or small <i>spicul&aelig;</i> may escape with
the thick, purulent, and offensive discharge.</p>

<p><b>Closure of the Tear Duct</b>. The lachrymal duct, or passage (tear
duct), which, when in a healthy condition, serves to convey the tears from
the eye into the nose, may be closed by the same inflammatory and
thickening process which we have already explained. This condition is
usually attended with watery and weak eyes, the tears escaping over the
cheeks, and sometimes producing irritation and excoriation. The nasal
branch of the ophthalmic nerve sometimes participates in the ulceration
going on in the head, so that the eyes are sympathetically affected. They
sometimes become congested or inflamed, and sharp pain in the eyeballs may
be experienced.</p>

<p><b>Indigestion, Dyspepsia, Etc</b>. A large portion of the acrid,
poisonous, purulent discharge, which drops into the throat during sleep, is
swallowed. This disturbs the functions of the stomach, causing weakness of
that organ, and producing indigestion, dyspepsia, nausea, and loss of
appetite. Many sufferers complain of a very distressing "gnawing sensation"
in the stomach, or an "all gone," or "faint feelings," as they often
express it.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. Dull, heavy headaches through the temples and above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478"></a>[pg
478]</span>the eyes; indisposition to exercise; difficulty of thinking or
reasoning, or concentrating the mind upon any subject; lassitude;
indifference respecting business, lack of ambition or energy; obstruction
of nasal passages; discharges voluntarily falling into the throat,
sometimes profuse, watery, acrid, thick and tenacious, mucous, purulent,
muco-purulent, bloody, concrete blood and pus, putrid, offensive, etc. In
others, a dryness of the nasal passages: dry, watery, weak, or inflamed
eyes; ringing in the ears, deafness, discharge from the ears, hawking and
coughing to clear the throat, ulcerations, death and decay of bones,
expectoration of putrid matter, <i>spicul&aelig;</i> of bones, scabs from
ulcers leaving surface raw, constant desire to clear the nose and throat,
voice altered, nasal twang, offensive breath, impairment or total
deprivation of the sense of smell and taste, dizziness, mental depression,
loss of appetite, nausea, indigestion, dyspepsia, enlarged tonsils, raw
throat, tickling cough, difficulty in speaking plainly, general debility,
idiocy, and insanity.</p>

<p>All the above symptoms, as well as some others which have been
previously given, and which it is not necessary here to repeat, are common
to this disease in some of its stages or complications; yet thousands of
cases annually terminate in consumption or chronic bronchitis, and end in
the grave, without ever having manifested one-half of the symptoms
enumerated.</p>

<p><b>Varieties</b>. People often suppose that there are a great many
varieties or species of catarrh. This is an error. The nature of the
disease is the same in all cases, the symptoms only varying with the
different stages of the disorder, and the various complicated conditions
which are liable to arise, and which have already been pointed out.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Anything which debilitates the system, or diminishes its
powers of evolving animal heat and withstanding cold or sudden changes of
atmospheric temperature, and other disease-producing agencies, renders the
individual thus enfeebled very liable to catarrh. Among the most common
debilitating agencies are a scrofulous condition of the system, or other
impurities of the blood, exhaustive fevers, and other prostrating acute
diseases, or those badly treated; exhaustive and unnatural discharges,
intemperance, excessive study, self-abuse, adversity, grief, want of sleep,
syphilitic taints of the system, which may have been contracted
unknowingly, or may have been inherited, having perhaps been handed down
even unto the third or fourth generation, to an innocent posterity from
infected progenitors; too sudden rest after great and fatiguing exercise,
and living in poorly-ventilated apartments. These are among the most
fruitful causes of those feeble, deranged, or impure conditions of the
system to which catarrh so frequently owes its origin. Although the
immediate or exciting cause is generally repeated attacks of "cold in the
head," which, being neglected or improperly treated; "go on from bad to
worse," yet the predisposing or real cause of the disease is in the
majority of cases, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479"
id="Page_479"></a>[pg 479]</span>an enfeebled, impure, or otherwise faulty
condition of the system, which invites the disease, and needs only the
irritation produced in the nasal passages by an attack of cold, to kindle
the flame and establish the loathsome malady. Some people are convinced
with difficulty that there exists in their system a weakness, impurity, or
derangement of any kind, which permitted the disease to fasten itself upon
them. They may not feel any great weakness, may not have any pimples,
blotches, eruptions, swellings, or ulcers, upon their whole person; in
fact, nothing about them that would, except to the skilled eye of the
practical and experienced physician, indicate that their system is weakened
or deranged with bad humors; and yet such a fault may, and <b>generally
does</b>, exist. As an ulcer upon the leg, or a "fever-sore," or an
eruption upon the skin, may be the only outward sign of a fault in the
system, so frequently chronic catarrh is the only sign by which a bad
condition of the system manifests itself in a manner that is perceptible to
the sufferer himself, or to the non-professional observer. The
finely-skilled physician, whose constant practice makes his perceptive
faculties perfect in this direction, would detect the constitutional fault,
as an experienced banker detects a finely-executed and dangerous bank-note
which the unpracticed eye would pronounce genuine.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. If you would remove an evil <i>strike at its root</i>.
As the predisposing or real cause of catarrh is, in the majority of cases,
some weakness, impurity, or otherwise faulty condition of the system, in
attempting to cure the disease our chief aim must be directed to the
removal of that cause. The more we see of this odious disease, the more so
we the importance of combining; with the use of a local, soothing <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480"></a>[pg 480]</span>and
healing application, a thorough and persistent internal use of
blood-cleansing and tonic medicines.</p>

<p>As a local application for healing the diseased condition in the head,
Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy is beyond all comparison the best preparation
ever invented. It is mild and pleasant to use, producing no smarting or
pain, and containing no strong, irritating, or caustic drug, or other
poison. Its ingredients are simple and harmless, yet when scientifically
and skillfully combined, in just the right proportions, they form a most
wonderful and valuable healing medicine. Like gunpowder, which is formed of
a combination of saltpeter, sulphur, and charcoal, the ingredients are
simple, but the product of their combination is wonderful in its effects.
The Remedy is a powerful antiseptic, and speedily destroys all bad smell
which accompanies so many cases of catarrh, thus affording great comfort to
those who suffer from this disease.</p>

<p>The reader's mind cannot be too strongly impressed with the importance
of combining thorough constitutional with the local treatment of this
disease. Not only will the cure be thus more surely, speedily, and
permanently, effected, but you thereby guard against other forms of disease
breaking out, as the result of humors in the blood or constitutional
derangement or weakness.</p>

<p>In curing catarrh and all the various diseases with which it is so
frequently complicated, as throat, bronchial, and lung diseases, weak
stomach, catarrhal deafness, weak or inflamed eyes, impure blood,
scrofulous and syphilitic taints, the wonderful powers and virtues of the
"Golden Medical Discovery" cannot be too strongly extolled. It has a
specific effect upon the lining mucous membranes of the nasal and other air
passages, promoting the natural secretion of their follicles and glands,
thereby softening the diseased and thickened membrane, and restoring it to
its natural, thin, delicate, moist, healthy condition. As a blood-purifier,
it is unsurpassed. As those diseases which complicate catarrh are diseases
of the lining mucous membranes, or of the blood, it will readily be seen
why this medicine is so well calculated to cure them.</p>

<p>The "Golden Medical Discovery" is the natural "helpmate" of Dr. Sage's
Catarrh Remedy. It not only cleanses, purifies, regulates, and builds up
the system to a healthy standard, and conquers throat, bronchial, and lung
complications, when any such exist, but, from its specific effects upon the
lining membrane of the nasal passages, it aids materially in restoring the
diseased, thickened, or ulcerated membrane to a healthy condition, and thus
eradicates the disease. When a cure is effected in this manner it is
permanent. The system is so purified, regulated, and strengthened, as to be
strongly fortified against the encroachments of catarrh and other diseases.
The effects of the "Golden Medical Discovery" upon the system will be
gradual, and the alterative changes of tissue and function generally
somewhat slow. They are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481"
id="Page_481"></a>[pg 481]</span>with however, less complete, radical, and
lasting; and this constitutes its great merit. Under its influence all the
secretions are aroused to carry the blood-poisons out of the system, the
nutrition is promoted, and the patient finds himself gradually improving in
flesh; his strength is built up, his lingering ailments dwindle away, and
by and by he finds his whole person has been entirely renovated and
repaired he feels like a new man&mdash;a perfect being.</p>

<p><b>The Clothing</b>. With most persons suffering from chronic nasal
catarrh, there is a great disposition to take cold, even slight cause being
sufficient to produce an acute attack, which greatly aggravates the chronic
affection and operates to render it permanent. To obviate the bad effects
that are liable to result from this predisposition, great attention should
be paid to the clothing, that it thoroughly protects the person from sudden
changes of temperature. For more particular and practical suggestions in
regard to this matter, the reader is referred to the article on Clothing,
in Part Two, Chapter II, of "The People's Common Sense Medical
Adviser."</p>

<p><b>The Diet</b> has an important influence with this disease, as with
consumption and many other chronic ailments. It should be largely composed
of those articles rich in the non-nitrogenized or carbonaceous elements.
Fat meats, rich, sweet cream, good butter, and other similar articles of
food, should comprise a large part of the diet. These elements, which are
prolific in the production of animal heat counteract the predisposition to
take cold, and thus become most valuable remedial agents&mdash;not less
essential than the medical treatment that has been advised. The patient,
suffering from chronic catarrh, should study well the hygienic teachings to
be found in Part Two of "The People's Common Sense Medical Adviser," and
govern himself accordingly.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of Complications</b>. There are various complications of
this disease that require modifications of the treatment to meet them
successfully. The rules cannot be made that would enable non-professional
readers to vary the treatment to suit peculiarities of constitution, or
complications of the disease. When consulted, either the person or by
letter, we have been able to so modify the treatment as to be adopt it to
peculiar individuals which rejected the ordinary treatment, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482"></a>[pg 482]</span>and
have thus cured hundreds who had otherwise failed to find relief.</p>

<p><b>Time Required in Effecting a Cure</b>. Reader, if you suffer from
chronic nasal catarrh, do not expect to be very speedily cured, especially
if your case is one of long standing. Unprincipled quacks and charlatans,
who possess no knowledge of disease, or medicine either, and whose sole
design is to palm off upon you a bottle or two of some worse than worthless
strong, caustic solution, irritating snuff, or drying "fumigator," "dry
up," "annihilator," "carbolated catarrh cure," "catarrh specific," or other
strong preparation, will tell you that the worst cases can be
<i>speedily</i> cured by these unreasonable means. It is true that such
strong, irritating, and drying preparations will many times suddenly arrest
the discharge from the nose, but the thickened or ulcerated condition of
the lining mucous membrane, which really constitutes the disease, is not
removed by such treatment, and the discharge soon comes on again. Besides,
there is danger attending the employment of such strong, irritating, or
drying preparations. The disease, by their use, is frequently driven to the
throat, bronchial tubes, lungs, or brain, and thus a bad matter is made
worse. Not less irrational and unsuccessful is the plan of treating the
disease with inhalations of "carbolized iodine," and other drags,
administered through variously-devised pocket and other inhalers. Such
treatment may mask or cover up catarrh for a time; <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_483" id="Page_483"></a>[pg 483]</span>but, by reason of the
constitutional nature of the disease, it cannot effect a perfect and
permanent cure. Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy, on the other hand, cures the
disease on common-sense, rational, and scientific principles, by its mild,
soothing, and healing properties, to which the disease gradually yields,
when the system has been put in perfect order by the use of "Golden Medical
Discovery." This is the only perfectly safe, scientific, and successful
mode of acting upon and healing it. Without, we trust, being considered
egotistical, we can say that this opinion is based upon a large experience
and a perfect familiarity with the nature and curability of the disease.
For many years our whole time and attention has been given to the study and
cure of catarrh and other chronic diseases treated of in "The People's
Common Sense Medical Adviser." Cases of catarrh have been treated by
thousands, and our medicines for the cure of this loathsome disease, and of
other chronic diseases, have met with an extensive sale in all parts of the
United States, and have found their way into many foreign countries. The
universal satisfaction with which their use has been attended, and the
grateful manifestations received from the cured, have afforded one of the
greatest pleasures of our lives. Scarcely a mail arrives that does not
bring new testimony of cures effected by the treatment here
recommended.</p>


<h4>DIRECTIONS FOR USING DR. SAGE'S CATARRH REMEDY.</h4>


<p>To prepare the medicine ready for use, put the whole quantity of powder
contained in the package, as put up for sale, into a bottle; pour into it
one pint of cool, soft water. Rain water or melted snow is good. Ordinary
lake, river, well or spring water will do if only <i>slightly</i> hard.
Cork the bottle tightly and shake it thoroughly, after which allow it to
stand six or eight hours to settle. Two of the ingredients of which the
remedy is composed do not entirely dissolve, but their medicinal properties
are completely and speedily extracted and taken up by the water. These
settlings have lost their medicinal properties and should not be allowed to
enter the nasal cavity. It should be kept tightly corked, not allowing it
to freeze in winter, or be kept where it is very warm in summer. This we
term the "Catarrh Remedy Fluid."</p>

<p>Use the fluid, prepared according to the above directions, not less than
three or four times a day, the last time just before retiring, in the
following manner: Without shaking the bottle to roll the fluid, pour out a
teaspoonful or more into the hollow of the hand, hold it there until
warmed; first gently, and afterwards forcibly, snuff the fluid up one
nostril and then the other, until the nose is well filled and it passes
back into the throat. No fears need be entertained that it will produce
strangling or any unpleasant effect in thus using it, for, unlike any <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484"></a>[pg 484]</span>other
fluids (simple tepid water not excepted), it does not produce the slightest
pain or disagreeable feeling, but, on the contrary, leaves such a cooling,
pleasant sensation that its use soon becomes a pleasure rather than a task.
In a few minutes after thus using the remedy, it should be blown out gently
(never forcibly), to clear the nose and throat of all hardened crusts and
offensive accumulations, if any such exist. Never blow the nose violently,
as it irritates the passages and counteracts, to some extent, the curative
effects of the remedy. This process should be repeated until the remedy has
been thoroughly applied two or three times, not blowing it out the last
time of using it, but retaining the medicine in contact with the affected
parts for a considerable length of time. No harm can result if the fluid be
swallowed, as it contains nothing poisonous or injurious.</p>

<p><b>A Better Way</b>. The manner of using Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy,
advised above, is somewhat imperfect and not nearly so thorough a mode as
the one to which the reader's attention will now be directed.</p>

<p>In a very large number of bad cases of catarrh, or those of long
standing, the disease has crept along and extended high up in the nasal
passages, and into the various sinuses or cavities, and tubes communicating
therewith. The act of snuffing the fluid <i>carries it along the floor of
the nose and into the throat</i>, but does not carry it <i>high enough</i>,
or fill the passages <i>full enough</i>, to reach all the chambers, tubes,
and surfaces, that are affected with the disease.</p>

<p>The fluid may seem, from the sensation produced, to pass high up between
the eyes, or even above them, but it does not. It is only a sensation
transmitted to these parts by nerves, the filaments of which are
distributed to that portion of the mucous membrane which the fluid does not
reach, just as a sensation is transmitted to the little finger by a blow
upon the elbow.</p>

<p>Now, in order to be most successful in the treatment of catarrh, it is
necessary that <i>the remedy should reach and be thoroughly applied to all
the affected parts</i>. This can be accomplished in only one way, which is
by <i>hydrostatic pressure</i>. The anatomy of the nasal passages, and the
various chambers and tubes that communicate therewith, is such that they
cannot be reached with fluid administered with any kind of syringe or
inhaling tube, or with any instrument, except one constructed to apply it
upon the principle above stated. Such an instrument is Dr. Pierce's Nasal
Douche.</p>

<p>By the use of this instrument, the fluid enters every portion of the
air-passages of the head by its own weight, no snuffing being required.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485"></a>[pg
485]</span><h4>DIRECTIONS FOR USING DR. SAGE'S CATARRH REMEDY WITH THIS
INSTRUMENT.</h4>




<p class="figure"><a name="advise172"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 12. This cut illustrates the manner of using Dr. Pierce's Nasal
Douche." src="images/advise172.png" /></a><br />Fig. 12. This cut
illustrates the manner of using Dr. Pierce's Nasal Douche.</p>

<p>To cleanse out the passages previous to applying the Catarrh Remedy
fluid, take one quart of soft water, add to it two large tablespoonfuls of
common salt, and shake it up occasionally until all is dissolved. Before
use heat it until blood warm, or, in other words, until it gives a
pleasant, mild warmth to the inserted finger. Put the reservoir on a shelf,
or hang it up, so that it will be a little higher than the head: fill the
reservoir with salt and water, pressing the tube between the thumb and
finger so as to prevent the fluid from escaping through it; introduce the
nozzle at the end of the tube into one nostril, pressing it in far enough
to close the entrance of the passage so that no fluid can escape by the
side of the tube, breathe through the mouth, avoid swallowing, and allow
the fluid to flow. The soft palate, by the act of breathing through the
mouth, is elevated so as to completely close the passage into the throat,
and thus the fluid is made to flow up one nostril in a gentle stream, to
pass into and thoroughly cleanse all the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_486" id="Page_486"></a>[pg 486]</span>sinuses, or cavities,
connected with the nasal passages, and to flow out of the other nostril.
The douche should not be employed unless both nostrils are open and the
flow is free. If the head is "stopped up," snuff up the warm liquid from
the hand occasionally, until the passages are open and you can breathe
freely through both nostrils.</p>

<p>Do not forget that the instrument will not work properly unless you
<i>breathe through the mouth and avoid swallowing</i> while the fluid
flows.</p>

<p>Fill the reservoir a second time with the simple salt and water, and,
inserting the nozzle into the nostril out of which the fluid flowed on
using it the first time, pass the current through in the opposite
direction; that is, so that it will flow out of the nostril into which it
flowed the first time of using it.</p>

<p>After having thus thoroughly cleansed the passages, fill the instrument
half full or more with the "Catarrh Remedy Fluid," prepared as heretofore
directed, and warmed to a moderate temperature, and pass this through the
nose in the same manner as directed for the salt water. The salt water is
not curative, but is milder than simple water, and is, therefore,
preferable for cleansing the passages.</p>

<p>On first commencing the use of the instrument, it is best to hang it
only a very little higher than the forehead, but after using it a few
times, put it up about as high as the length of the tube will admit.</p>

<p>Let no one entertain any feeling of timidity on commencing the use of
this instrument, as its operation is perfectly simple and harmless, and,
with the fluids which we recommend, is never attended with any strangling,
choking, pain, or other disagreeable sensations. The medicine should be
applied with the Douche at least twice a day, in the morning and at night
on retiring. There is no advantage in using the medicine oftener than three
times a day, when used with the instrument, but a <i>sufficient</i>
quantity should be used each time to medicate all the diseased parts. If
any remains in the Douche it may be poured back into the stock solution for
subsequent use, but a liquid that has once passed through the nasal cavity
contains the germs of the disease and must not be used a second time.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487"></a>[pg
487]</span><h3>NASAL POLYPUS.</h3>


<p>The term Nasal Polypus is usually given to a variety of growths which
are met with in the nasal passages far more frequently than any other
tumors. They are thus designated because of their fancied resemblance to
the aquatic polypus. They occur singly, or in clusters, as illustrated in
Fig. 13. In the early stages the mucous membrane is swollen and irregularly
dilated, presenting a rough and mottled appearance not unlike chronic
catarrh with which they are usually associated. Gradually these mound-like
tumors enlarge, usually becoming pendulant, and presenting a grayish opaque
glistening surface, similar to the pulp of a grape. Occasionally they
become massive at the point of attachment, and assimilate a warty or
cauliflower growth. The latter variety is better supplied with blood
vessels and presents a red or dark pink surface and may bleed on slight
irritation. The favorite location is beneath or behind the middle or
superior turbinated bodies, oftentimes nearly or quite concealed. However,
no portion of the mucous membrane lining the upper air passages is exempt.
Sometimes they grow from the roof of the nostril and pharnyx in pendulous
masses, assuming the shape of the cavities, filling the entire nostril and
upper portion of pharnyx. The mucous membrane covering the turbinated
bodies may become dilated and swollen, finally developing by catarrhal
processes into a polypus at that point. (See <i>H</i>, Fig. 13.)</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise173"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 13. NASAL POLYPI." src="images/advise173.png" /></a><br />Fig. 13.
NASAL POLYPI.  <i>A</i>. Anterior opening of the nostril. <i>B</i>. Soft
Palate, <i>C</i>. Orifice of the Eustachian tube. <i>D, D</i>. Superior and
inferior turbinated bodies. <i>E</i>. Large Polypus. <i>F</i>. Several
small Polypi. G. Throat. <i>H</i>. Polypoid growth on turbinated body.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Nothing definitely is known regarding their causation.
They are generally supposed to originate in some constitutional
derangement, impairing the nutrition of the mucous membranes. Other cases
are closely associated with chronic nasal catarrh, and frequent attacks of
cold in the head.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. These may vary considerably in different cases due to
the character and location of the polypus. In the early stages before the
tumor is well developed, the symptoms may be those of nasal catarrh, and
the diagnosis of polypus be possible only after a personal examination by a
skillful specialist. Neither is the size of the polypus <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488"></a>[pg 488]</span>always
in proportion to the severity of the symptoms. The nasal discharge is
generally increased and of a variable character. As the tumors enlarge they
cause a sense of fullness and weight between and below the eyes, with more
or less headache and facial neuralgia. There is partial or complete
obstruction of one or both nostrils. In some cases the obstruction changes
from one nostril to the other when lying down; the stoppage generally being
on the side toward the pillow. A polypus located at the junction of the
nasal passages and throat by force of gravity always causes obstruction to
the lower nasal cavity when lying down. Polypi often attain considerable
size and by pressure upon and displacement of the surrounding structures
occasion hideous facial deformity. Changes in the weather often aggravate
the symptoms. By blowing the nostril the tumor sometimes may be forced
forward, so that it may be seen a short distance from the anterior opening
of the nostril. The <i>voice</i> is often affected, being muffled or harsh
in tone, similar to that which accompanies a cold in the head.
<i>Respiration</i> may be considerably embarrassed, due to the obstruction
in the nasal passages, and the patient necessarily resorts to mouth
breathing. In advanced cases the Larnyx is usually much congested, being
constantly irritated, not only reflexly through the nervous system, but
directly by the inspired air, and excoriating discharges dropping in the
throat from behind the palate. Thus it is plain to understand how chronic
Pharyngitis, Laryngitis, Bronchitis, and Asthma may result from a small
polypus in the nasal cavity.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In mild cases correcting the constitutional
derangement may check the morbid process in the nostrils and cause
absorption of the polypus growth. For this purpose Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery is unequaled. The removal of the polypus may sometimes be
accomplished by snuffing powdered blood-root. When these measures fail it
is necessary to seek surgical assistance. After the removal of the polypus
Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy should be used to prevent a recurrence.</p>


<h4>OUR OPERATION FOR NASAL TUMORS.</h4>


<p>Having operated with unvarying success upon a very large number and
variety of nasal tumors at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute we
are positively assured that the means and methods which we employ are
neither severe or dangerous; <i>no pain</i>, consequently <i>no shock</i>;
recovery rapid and permanent. Many forms of injection and local treatment
are in use for the removal of nasal polypi, none of which have proven to be
curative; recurrence of the tumor many times following such treatment. Many
cases have presented themselves after having been treated by the heroic
method of seizing the polypus with a pair of forceps and forcibly tearing
it loose, bringing with it segments of healthy tissue, leaving bone
exposed, and a ragged, uneven surface of diseased membrane. It is much
easier to properly <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489"
id="Page_489"></a>[pg 489]</span>treat a case from the beginning than to
undertake it in such a rendition.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that these nasal tumors grow directly from the lining
membranes it is necessary not only to thoroughly remove the tumor but to
treat the diseased membrane at the point from which the polypus springs;
otherwise another tumor may develop at the same point. The nasal passage
having been thoroughly an&aelig;sthetized, or benumbed, by the use of cocaine,
the nasal speculum is introduced, and by means of reflected light from the
head mirror worn by the operator, the interior of the nostril is brought
into view. (See Fig. 9, p. 479.)</p>

<p>Often the attachment of the growth is entirely hidden behind the
irregular bony structures of the nostril so that it requires the skill of
an expert specialist, deft in the manipulation of these parts, to operate
properly.</p>

<p>Many styles and shapes of delicately devised instruments are necessary
to completely remove the growth without doing injury to the adjacent
structures. By our newly devised operation the tumor is at once removed,
without pain, and with the loss of only a few drops of blood. Further,
because the tumor is entirely removed and the base properly treated there
is not the offensive discharge for a long time afterward and the danger
from infection and blood-poison to which the patient is subjected in other
forms of treatment.</p>

<p>In conclusion we would say that we claim for our operation the following
points that are worthy of the careful consideration of every one who may be
so unfortunate as to require the services of a specialist for the removal
of growths in the nasal or upper air passages.</p>

<p>1st. Our operation is absolutely painless.</p>

<p>2d. No chloroform or ether is required.</p>

<p>3d. We insure perfect removal of growth.</p>

<p>4th. There is no injury to other adjacent structures.</p>

<p>5th. The operation is bloodless.</p>

<p>6th. The recovery is rapid.</p>

<p>7th. There is no slough to produce pus that may be absorbed and cause
blood-poisoning.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490"></a>[pg
490]</span><h3>DEFORMITY OF THE NASAL SEPTUM.</h3>


<p>In health the nasal septum is a bony or cartilaginous plate, as shown in
<i>A</i>, Fig. 14, dividing the nasal passages into two cavities of the
same size and shape. This plate or partition is also a support to which the
flexible structures which form the tip of the nose are attached. In early
life the septum is flexible and may be bent or doubled by injury to the
nose; but owing to its elasticity usually resumes its natural position and
shape. After maturity any dislocation or change in this bony plate usually
remains permanent unless some means are employed for its correction. In a
limited number of cases supposed to be chronic nasal catarrh, we have found
upon examination that one or both nasal cavities were more or less
obliterated and obstructed by the deformed and thickened septum. (See
<i>A</i>, Fig. 15.) Many of these cases date from an injury to the external
parts, causing only bleeding from the nose and a slight pain for a short
time. Chronic inflammation develops at the point where the bone is bent or
cracked, resulting in thickening, often producing nodules or spur-like
projections which not only interfere with nasal breathing, but also act as
irritants to the adjacent delicate membranes and produce many of the
symptoms common to nasal catarrh.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise174"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:

projecting portion of the nose removed." src="images/advise174.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 14. Anterior view of the healthy nasal passages as seen
with the projecting portion of the nose removed.  <i>A.</i> Vertical septum
or bony plate separating nostrils. <i>B, B.</i> Turbinated bodies. <i>C,
C.</i> Nasal passages.</p>

<p>Among other common causes are unequal or imperfect development of the
nasal bones, due to an inherited strumous tendency and local ulcerative
disease, weakening or destroying the bone.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The location and extent of the deformity of the nasal
septum necessarily gives opportunity for a variety of symptoms. In
aggravated cases the nose appears to be bent toward one side. In the
earlier stages there is an excess of mucous secretion, often dropping <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491"></a>[pg 491]</span>into
the throat from behind the palate. The discharge is variable as in nasal
catarrh with more or less difficult nasal breathing, the stoppage changing
from one nostril to the other. Sneezing and frequent attacks of nose bleed
are often common symptoms. The tendency of the disease is to extend
backward often causing headache, deafness, roaring in the ears and
post-nasal disease which results in a chronic sore throat, the latter
disease often being the one for which the patient seeks advice. If allowed
to progress uninterruptedly the throat gradually becomes more irritable,
associated with an annoying cough, and the voice becomes harsh and has a
nasal tone. The general health is impaired, the nervous system excitable;
laryngitis, asthma, and lung disease become complications, which render the
existence of the individual miserable.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In mild cases where the deformity is slight, and the
obstruction is not a constant symptom, the nasal cavities should be
cleansed (See treatment of nasal catarrh) after inhaling dust, and special
attention given to the prompt treatment of cold in the head. Should there
be irritability, sneezing, or a constant discharge, it is advisable to use
Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy as directed on p. 483 to soothe the excitability
and lessen the inflammatory action in and about the thickened and deformed
septum. As an auxiliary to promote the absorption of the thickened tissues
and restore them to a healthy activity, a number of bottles of the "Golden
Medical Discovery" should be taken while using the local treatment. Any
dormant condition of the liver or digestive tract may be corrected by
taking Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Purgative Pellets. In advanced cases after the
structures are so diseased and thickened that it renders local treatment
hopeless, only surgical interference can prove curative.</p>


<h4>OUR PAINLESS OPERATION.</h4>


<p>By the application of a few drops of a solution of cocaine in the
nostril, at the point to be treated, we are now able to produce such local
an&aelig;sthesia as to render the operation entirely painless without the
administration of either chloroform or ether. This is an important
consideration as many are adverse to taking chloroform or ether, and now
that we possess an agent that produces, locally, complete insensibility to
pain, we are very glad to dispense with their use in all such minor
operations. There is no pain caused even by the application of the cocaine
to deaden the sensibility of the part. Many examinations of the upper
air-passages heretofore very annoying and even painful to the patient and
sometimes unsatisfactory, are rendered entirely painless, and carried out
with a thoroughness that would be impossible without the use of this
wonderful agent. Not only in surgery of the nose and throat, but alike in
other departments, our surgeon-specialists employ the same local
an&aelig;sthetic in all minor operations, none of which are attended with
the least pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492"></a>[pg
492]</span>Our specialists were among the first surgeons in this country to
employ this newly-discovered an&aelig;sthetic. We regard it as a great boon
to our patients, and never withhold it in any case where it can be employed
to prevent suffering. Its use is attended with no danger, nor is it
followed by bad or disagreeable results.</p>


<h4>OUR OPERATION.</h4>




<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise175"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:

thickened septum or bony plate separating nostrils. <i>B, B.</i> Irregular
and obstructed nasal passages. <i>C.</i> Diseased and swollen turbinated

<p>The nostrils being the entrance to and the beginning of the air passages
no dexterity and skill can be spared in treating and properly correcting
any deformity that may exist. Mutilation of these sensitive structures is
sure to be followed by serious reflex symptoms in adjacent parts.</p>

<p>Consequently cases of this nature should only be entrusted to the care
of a competent and experienced specialist. Our resources and appliances are
unlimited and seldom do we use the surgeon's knife in a case of this
nature.</p>

<p>As in the treatment of other pathological growths in the upper air
passages the rhinoscope is indispensable. The parts can only be brought
into the view of the operator by means of this instrument and sets of
mirrors to reflect light on all sides of the deformed and hidden parts.</p>

<p>By our operation both nasal cavities are restored to their normal size
and contour (compare Figs. 14, 15), unhealthy and diseased tissues are
removed, and free nasal respiration established.</p>

<p>All treatments are carried out under strict aseptic precautions, thus
reducing the danger from absorption of poisonous secretions to the minimum.
By our skillful and ingenious management of these cases we never have had a
single patient manifest any serious symptoms after operation. In such cases
we consider this the only safe, practical, and permanent cure. Every year
hundreds pass out of existence <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493"
id="Page_493"></a>[pg 493]</span>the victims of incurable disease of the
air-passages resulting from morbid nasal conditions, who might be saved by
proper and timely treatment.</p>


<h4>PHARYNGITIS AND POST-NASAL CATARRH.</h4>

Interior of nasal passage.</p>

<p>Simple chronic pharyngitis seldom exists alone and uncomplicated; most
cases being the result of previous existing disease of the nasal or
post-nasal passages. Many cases are associated with hypertrophy, or
enlargement, of the tonsils. Usually the disease is located in the upper
part of the pharynx, or throat, behind and above the uvula and soft palate,
and is thus hidden from view when looking into the throat through the
mouth. When not associated with nasal catarrh the common symptoms are
dropping of tenacious mucous in the throat, causing a constant desire to
hawk and spit; sense of dryness in this region; cough and expectoration on
rising in the morning, which is due to the irritability of the throat, and
may invade the lower air-passages. The throat may be studded with red and
thickened patches of its mucous membrane. Respiration may be embarrassed,
the voice affected and the general health gradually decline. The membrane
above and behind the palate is angry, reddened, thickened and roughened, as
represented in <i>G</i>, Fig. 16.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b> To rationally treat a disease, attack the cause.
Therefore, in an uncomplicated case of post-nasal disease of the pharynx
the medicine should be applied at this point. For this purpose we recommend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494"></a>[pg
494]</span>the regular and continuous use of Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy
administered preferably by means of the post-nasal syringe as illustrated
in Fig. 16.</p>

<p>The efficacy of Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy as a curative agent in catarrh
of mucous membranes is unequaled if the medicine be properly and thoroughly
applied. The Catarrh Remedy fluid should be prepared as directed in the
pamphlet which accompanies the medicine. Warm enough of the medicine to
fill the syringe twice. After the syringe is filled with the warm medicine,
introduce the curved tip behind the soft palate, holding the syringe as
seen in Fig. 16, then incline the head forward over a wash bowl and empty
the syringe by pressing the plunger quickly. The medicine will immediately
come in contact with the diseased surfaces and pass out through the
nostrils, thoroughly medicating, disinfecting and cleansing the upper part
of the throat and the posterior region of the nostrils. Two syringes of the
medicine should be used for each treatment, and two or more applications
made every day until a cure is effected.</p>

<p>At the same time the local treatment is being used, Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery should be taken to act through the blood upon the
diseased tissues.</p>

<p>The Catarrh Remedy may be administered by means of the Nasal Douche, if
the case is complicated by nasal catarrh. Should tumors or deformities
exist, it is advisable to consult a specialist.</p>

<h2>ENLARGED TONSILS.</h2>


<p>Chronic enlargement of the tonsils, as shown in Fig. 17, <i>A A</i>, is
an exceedingly common affection. It is most common to those of a scrofulous
habit. It rarely makes its appearance after the thirtieth year, unless it
has been imperfectly cured. Both tonsils are generally, though unequally
enlarged. A person affected with this disease is extremely liable to sore
throat, and contracts it on the slightest exposure; the contraction of a
cold, suppression of perspiration, or derangement of the digestive
apparatus being sufficient to provoke inflammation.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Repeated attacks of quinsy, scarlet fever, diphtheria, or
scrofula, and general impairment of the system, predispose the individual
to this disease.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The voice is often husky, nasal or guttural, and
disagreeable. When the patient sleeps, a low moaning is heard, accompanied
with snoring and stentorian breathing, and the head is thrown back so as to
bring the mouth on a line with the windpipe, and thus facilitate the
ingress of air into the lungs. When the affection becomes serious it
interferes with breathing and swallowing. The <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_495" id="Page_495"></a>[pg 495]</span>chest is liable to become
flattened in front and arched behind, in consequence of the difficulty of
respiration, thus predisposing the patient to pulmonary disease. On looking
into the throat, the enlarged tonsils may be seen, as in the Fig. 17.
Sometimes they are so greatly increased in size that they touch each
other.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise175c"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 17." src="images/advise175c.png" /></a><br />Fig. 17. <i>A. A.</i>
Enlarged Tonsils. <i>B</i>. Elongated Uvula.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The indications to be carried out in the cure of this
malady are:</p>

<p>(1.) To remedy the constitutional derangement.</p>

<p>(2.) To remove the enlargement of the tonsilar glands.</p>

<p>The successful fulfillment of the first indication may be readily
accomplished by attention to hygiene, diet, clothing, and the use of Dr.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, together with small daily doses of his
"Pleasant Pellets." This treatment should be persevered in for a
considerable length of time after the enlargement has disappeared, to
prevent a return.</p>

<p>To fulfill the second indication, astringent gargles may be used.
Infusions of witch-hazel or cranesbill should be used during the day. The
following mixture is unsurpassed: iodine, one drachm; iodide of potash,
four drachms; pure, soft water, two ounces. Apply this preparation to the
enlarged tonsils twice a day, with a probang, or soft swab, being careful
to paint them each time. A persevering use of these remedies, both internal
and local, is necessary to reduce and restore the parts to a healthy
condition.</p>

<p>Sometimes the enlarged tonsils undergo calcareous degeneration; in this
case, nothing but their removal by a surgical operation is effectual. This
can be readily accomplished by any competent surgeon. We have operated in a
large number of cases, and have never met with my unfavorable results.</p>

<p>The method we adopt at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute for
the removal of diseased tonsils is, like other minor operations, painless.
The patient is not required to take chloroform or ether. When the enlarged
gland is once thoroughly removed the disease seldom returns.</p>


<h4>ELONGATION OF THE UVULA.</h4>


<p>Chronic enlargement, or elongation of the uvula or soft palate, as shown
at <i>B</i> in Fig. 17, may arise from the same causes as enlargement of
the tonsils. It subjects the individual to a great deal of annoyance <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496"></a>[pg 496]</span>by
dropping into or irritating the throat. It causes tickling and frequent
desire to clear the throat, also change, weakness and loss of voice, and
often gives rise to a very persistent and aggravating cough. Constriction
of the throat, cough and difficult breathing are more prominent symptoms in
complicated cases.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The treatment already laid down for enlarged tonsils,
with which affection, elongation of the uvula is so often associated, is
generally effectual. When it has existed for a long time, and does not
yield to this treatment it may be removed by any competent surgeon.</p>

<hr />


<h2>CHRONIC LARYNGITIS.</h2>


<p>This is of much more frequent occurrence than the acute form, and is
often associated with tubercular affections, and constitutional syphilis.
It is characterized by an inflammatory condition, ulceration, or hardening
of the mucous membrane of the larynx, most frequently the latter. There is
also a chronic form, known as <i>follicular laryngitis</i>, or
<i>clergymen's sore throat</i>, to which public speakers are subject.</p>

<p><b>The Causes</b> of chronic laryngitis are various, as prolonged use of
the vocal organs in reading or speaking; using them too long on one pitch
or key, without regard to their modulation; improper treatment of acute
diseases of the throat; neglected nasal catarrh; the inordinate use of
mercury; syphilis; repeated colds which directly cause sore throat,
injuries, etc. It is also frequently due to tubercular deposits, and in
these cases it generally terminates in consumption.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The affection often comes on insidiously. There is
soreness of the throat, noticeable particularly when speaking, and
immediately thereafter; a "raw" and constricted feeling, leading to
frequent attempts to clear the throat, in order to relieve the uneasy
sensation. The voice becomes altered, hoarse, and husky, and there is a
slight, peculiar cough, with but little expectoration. At first, the matter
expectorated is mucus, but as the disease advances, and ulceration
progresses, it becomes muco-purulent, perhaps lumpy, bloody, or is almost
wholly pure pus. The voice becomes more and more impaired, and is finally
lost. In the latter stages, it resembles consumption, being attended with
hectic fever, night-sweats, emaciation, cough, profuse expectoration, and
sometimes hemorrhage.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The patient should avoid using his voice as much as
possible. At the same time, attention should be paid to the diet, the
bathing, and the clothing. Every thing should be done that is calculated to
build up and improve the general health. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery is well adapted to remove morbid states of the disease, in
consequence of its direct action on the mucous membranes of the
air-passages, and its efficacy in allaying irritation of the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497"></a>[pg
497]</span>laryngeal, pharyngeal, and pneumogastric nerves. It should be
perseveringly employed. Iodine inhalations, administered with the pocket
inhaler, illustrated by Fig. 3, and the application of tincture of iodine
to the forepart of the neck, are efficacious in many cases. Inhalations of
chloride of ammonia, administered with a steam-atomizer, Fig. 11, in the
form of spray, are frequently of great benefit. <i>Perseverance</i> is
necessary, and the afflicted are cautioned against discontinuing the
treatment too soon, for the disease is very liable to return.</p>

<hr />


<h2>CONSUMPTION.</h2>

<h4>PHTHISIS PULMONALIS.</h4>


<p>By this we understand a constitutional affection, characterized by a
wasting away of the body, attended by the deposition of tubercular matter
into the lung tissue. Hence the appellations, <i>Phthisis Pulmonalis;
Pulmonary Tuberculosis; Tubercular Consumption</i>. Tubercles may form in
other organs and result in a breaking down of their tissues, but the
employment of the term <i>Consumption</i> in this article is restricted to
the lungs. The general prevalence, the insidious attack, and the
distressing fatality of this disease, demand the special attention and
investigation of every thinking person. It preys upon all classes of
society. Rich and poor alike furnish its victims.</p>

<p>Some idea of its prevalence may be formed when we consider that, of the
entire population of the globe, one in every three hundred and twenty-three
persons annually dies of consumption. It may not be definitely known just
what proportion of all the deaths in this country and Europe occurs from
this one disease. Those who have gathered statistics differ somewhat, some
claiming one-fourth, while others put the ratio at one-sixth, one-seventh,
and even as low as one-ninth. A fair estimate, and one probably very near
the truth, would be one-sixth or one-seventh of the whole number. In New
York City, for five consecutive years, the proportion was three in twenty.
In New England, about twenty thousand annually succumb to this destroyer,
and in the State of New York as many more. These figures may appear to be
exaggerations, but investigations of the subject prove them to be the
simple truth. Epidemics of cholera, yellow fever, and other diseases of
similar character, so terrible in their results, occasion wide-spread
alarm, and receive the most careful considerations for their prevention and
cure, while consumption receives scarcely a thought. Yet the number of
their victims sinks into insignificance when compared with those of
consumption. Like the thief in the night, it steals upon its victim
unawares. In a large proportion of cases, its approach is so insidious that
the early symptoms are almost wholly disregarded; indeed, they excite but
little, if any, attention, and perhaps for a time <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_498" id="Page_498"></a>[pg 498]</span>disappear altogether. Thus
the patient's suspicions, if they have been aroused, are allayed and
appropriate measures for his relief are discontinued. This may be the case
until renewed attacks firmly establish the disease, and before the patient
is fully aware of the fatal tendency of his malady, he is progressing
rapidly towards that "bourne from which no traveler returns."</p>

<p>As has already been stated, consumption is a constitutional disease,
manifested by feeble vitality, loss of strength, emaciation&mdash;symptoms which
are too often classed under the name of <i>general debility</i>, until
local symptoms develop, as <i>cough, difficult breathing</i>, or
<i>hemorrhage</i>, when examination of the chest reveals the startling fact
that tubercular deposits have been formed in the lungs. Invalids are seldom
willing to believe that they have consumption, until it is so far advanced
that all medicine can do is to smooth the pathway to the grave. Another
characteristic of this disease is <i>hope</i>, which remains active until
the very last, flattering the patient into expectation of recovery. To the
influence of this emotion, the prolongation of the patient's life may often
be attributed.</p>

<p><b>Nature of the Disease</b>. It is an error to suppose that the disease
under consideration is confined to the lungs. "Pulmonary Consumption," as
has been remarked, "is but a <i>fragment</i> of a great constitutional
malady." The lungs are merely the stage where it plays its most conspicuous
part. Every part of the system is more or less involved, every vital
operation more or less deranged; especially is the <i>nutritive</i>
function vitiated and imperfect. The circulation is also involved in the
general morbid condition. Tubercles, which constitute a marked feature of
the disease, are composed of unorganized matter, deposited from the blood
in the tissue of the lungs. They are small globules of a yellow, opaque,
friable substance, of about the consistency of cheese. After their
deposition, they are increased in size by the accretion of fresh matter of
the same kind. They are characteristic of all forms of scrofulous
disease.</p>

<p>The most plausible theory in regard to them is, that they are the result
of imperfect nutrition. Such a substance cannot be produced in the blood
when this fluid is perfectly formed. It is an unorganized particle of
matter, resulting from the imperfect elaboration of the products of
digestion, which is not, therefore, properly fitted for assimilation with
the tissues. The system being unable to appropriate it, and powerless to
cast in off through the excretory channels, deposits it in the lungs or
other parts of the body. There it remains as a foreign substance, like a
splinter or thorn in the flesh, until ejected by suppuration and sloughing
of the surrounding parts. It might be supposed by some that when the
offending matter was thus eliminated from the lungs, they would heal and
the patient recover; but, unfortunately, the deposition of tubercular
matter does no cease. Owing to the morbid action of the vital forces, it is
formed and deposited as fast <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499"
id="Page_499"></a>[pg 499]</span>or faster than it can be thrown off by
expectoration. Hence arises the remarkable fatality of pulmonary
consumption.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. The causes of consumption are numerous and varied, but
may all be classed under two heads, viz: <i>Constitutional</i>, or
<i>predisposing</i>, and <i>local</i>, or <i>exciting</i>. Of just what
tubercular matter consists, is still a subject of controversy, but that its
existence depends upon certain conditions, either <i>congenital</i> or
<i>acquired</i>, is generally conceded; and one of these conditions is
impaired vitality. Constitutional predisposition must first give rise to
conditions which will admit of the formation of tubercular matter, before
any cause whatever can occasion its local deposition. It must modify the
vitality of the whole system, when other causes may determine in the system
thus impaired, the peculiar morbid action of which tubercular matter is the
product. The general division of causes into predisposing and exciting,
must ever be more or less arbitrary. Individuals subject to predisposing
causes may live the natural term of life and finally die of other disease.
Indeed, when predisposing causes are known to exist, they should constitute
a warning for the avoidance of other causes. Again, among the so-called
exciting causes, some may operate in such a manner, with some individuals,
as to predispose them to consumption, and the result will be the same as if
the disposition had been congenital. The causes which in one individual are
<i>exciting</i>, under other circumstances and in other individuals, would
be <i>predisposing</i>, because they act so as to depress the vitality and
impair the nutritive processes.</p>

<p><b>The Predisposing Causes</b>, then, are hereditary predisposition,
scrofula, debility of the parents, climatic influences, sedentary habits,
depressing emotions, in fact, <i>anything</i> which impairs the vital
forces and interferes with the perfect elaboration of nutritive
material.</p>

<p><b>The Exciting Causes</b> are those which are capable of arousing the
predisposing ones into activity, and which, in some instances, may
themselves induce predisposition; as dyspepsia, nasal catarrh, colds,
suppressed menstruation, bronchitis, retrocession of cutaneous affections,
measles, scarlatina, malaria, whooping-cough, small-pox, continued fevers,
pleurisy, pneumonia, long-continued influence of cold, sudden prolonged
exposure to cold, sudden suspension of long-continued discharges,
masturbation, excessive venery, wastes from excessive mental activity,
insufficient diet, both as regards quantity and quality, exposure to impure
air, atmospheric vicissitudes, dark dwellings, dampness, prolonged
lactation, depressing mental emotions, insufficient clothing, improper
treatment of other diseases, exhaustive discharges, tight lacing, fast life
in fashionable society, and impurity and impoverishment of blood from any
cause. This list might be greatly extended, but the other causes are
generally in some manner allied to those already named.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The symptoms of consumption vary with the progress of
the disease. Writers generally recognize three stages, which so <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500"></a>[pg
500]</span>gradually change from one to the other that a dividing line
cannot be drawn. As the disease progresses, new conditions develop, which
are manifested by new symptoms. Prior to the advent of pulmonary symptoms,
is the latent period, which may extend over a variable length of time, from
a few months to several years; and, indeed, may never be developed any
farther. Until sufficient tubercular matter has been deposited in the lungs
to alter the sounds observed on auscultation and percussion, a definite
diagnosis of tubercular consumption cannot be made, even though there may
have been hemorrhage. Nevertheless, when we find <i>paleness, emaciation,
accelerated and difficult breathing, increased frequency of the pulse, an
increase of temperature</i>, and <i>general debility</i> coming on
gradually without any apparent cause, we have sufficient grounds for grave
suspicions. These are increased if tenderness under the collar-bone, with a
slight, hacking cough is present. These symptoms should be sufficient to
warn any individual who has the slightest reason to believe that he is
disposed to consumption, to lose no time in instituting the appropriate
hygienic and medical treatment, for it is at this stage that remedies will
be found most effective. Unfortunately, this period is too apt to pass
unheeded, or receive but trifling attention; the patient finds some trivial
excuse for his present condition, and believes that he will soon be well.
But, alas for his anticipations! The disease goes onward and onward,
gradually gaining ground, from which it will be with great difficulty
dislodged.</p>

<p>The cough now becomes sufficiently harassing to attract attention, and
is generally worse in the morning. The expectoration is slight and frothy;
the pulse varies from ninety to one hundred and twenty beats in a minute,
and sometimes even exceeds this. Flushes of heat and a burning sensation on
the soles of the feet and palms of the hands are experienced. A
circumscribed redness of one or both cheeks is apparent. These symptoms
increase in the afternoon, and in the evening are followed by a sense of
chilliness more or less severe. The appetite may be good, even voracious;
but the patient remarks that his food "does not seem to do him any good,"
and, to use a popular expression, "he is going into a decline." As the
strength wanes the cough becomes more and more severe, as if occasioned by
a fresh cold, in which way the patient vainly tries to account for it.
Expectoration increases, becomes more opaque, and, perhaps, yellow, with
occasionally slight dots or streaks of blood. The fever increases, and
there is more pain and oppression of the chest, particularly during deep
respiration after exercise. Palpitation is more severe. There may now be
night-sweats, tire patient waking in the morning to find himself drenched
in perspiration, exhausted, and haggard. Bleeding from the lungs occurs,
and creates alarm and astonishment, often coming on suddenly without
warning. The hemorrhage usually ceases spontaneously, or on the
administration of proper remedies, and in a few days the patient feels
better than he has felt for some time previously. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_501" id="Page_501"></a>[pg 501]</span>The cough is less severe,
and the breathing less difficult. Indeed, a complete remission sometimes
occurs, and both patient and friends deceive themselves with the belief
that the afflicted one is getting well.</p>

<p>After an indefinite length of time, the symptoms return with greater
severity. These remissions and aggravations may be repeated several times,
each successive remission being less perfect, each recurrence more severe,
carrying the patient further down the road toward the "dark valley." Now
the cough increases, the paroxysms become more severe, the expectoration
more copious and purulent, as the tubercular deposits soften and break
down. The voice is hollow and reverberating, the chest is flattened, and
loses its mobility; the collar-bones are prominent, with marked depression
above and below. Auscultation reveals a bubbling, gurgling sound, as the
air passes through the matter in the bronchi, with the click, to the air
cells beyond. Percussion gives a dull sound or if there are large cavities,
it is hollow, and auscultation elicits the amphoric sound, as of blowing
into a bottle. Hectic fever is now fully established; the eye is unusually
bright and pearly, with dilated pupils, which gives a peculiar expression;
the paroxysms of coughing exhaust the patient, and he gasps and pants for
breath. The tongue now becomes furred, the patient thirsty, the bowels
constipated, and all the functions are irregularly performed. Another
remission may now occur, and the patient be able to resume light
employment, for an indefinite length of time, which we have known to extend
over three or four years, when the symptoms again return.</p>

<p>If the patient is a female, and deranged or suppressed menstruation has
not marked the accession of pulmonary symptoms, the flow now becomes
profuse and clotted, or is scanty and colorless, sometimes ceasing
altogether. In the male, the sexual powers diminish, and copulation is
followed by excessive and long-continued prostration. From this time
onward, the progress of the disease is more rapid. The liver and kidneys
are implicated. In addition to the pallor, the complexion becomes
jaundiced, giving the patient, who is now wasting to a mere skeleton, a
ghastly look. The urine is generally copious and limpid, though
occasionally scanty and yellow. The pulse increases to one hundred and
thirty or one hundred and forty beats in the minute, and is feeble and
thread-like. The cough harasses the patient so that he does not sleep, or
his rest is fitful and unrefreshing; whenever sleep does occur, the patient
wakes to find himself drenched with a cold, clammy perspiration. The
throat, mouth, and tongue now become tender, and occasionally ulcerate.
Expectoration is profuse, purulent, and viscid, clinging tenaciously to the
throat and mouth, and the patient no longer has strength to eject it. The
hair now falls off, the nails become livid, and the breathing difficult and
gasping; the patient has no longer strength to move himself in bed and has
to be propped up <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502"
id="Page_502"></a>[pg 502]</span>with pillows, and suffocates on assuming
the recumbent position. Drinks are swallowed with difficulty. Diarrhea
takes the place of constipation. The extremities are cold, swollen, and
dropsical; the voice feeble, hollow, grating, husky, the patient gasping
between each word; the respiration is short and quick. A slight remission
of these symptoms occurs. The patient is more comfortable, lively,
cheerful, and perhaps forms plans for the future. But it is the last effort
of expiring vitality, the last flicker of the lamp of life, the candle
burns brilliantly for a moment, and with one last effort goes out, and
death closes the scene.</p>

<p>The duration of the active stage of consumption varies from a few weeks
to several years, the average time being about eighteen months.</p>

<p><i>Cough</i> is always a prominent symptom throughout the entire course
of the disease, varying with its progress.</p>

<p><i>Expectoration</i>, at first scanty, then slightly increased,
colorless, frothy, and mucous, is also a characteristic. After a time it
becomes opaque, yellow, and more or less watery; then muco-purulent and
finally purulent, copious, and viscid. When tubercular matter is freely
expectorated, with but little mucus, it sinks in water. This symptom
continues to the very last.</p>

<p><i>H&aelig;moptysis</i> (bleeding from the lungs) may occur at any stage of
the disease, often being the first pulmonary symptom noticed, again being
delayed until late; and there are cases in which it does not happen at all.
It seldom occurs in any other disease.</p>

<p><i>Night-sweats</i> may occur at any stage, though they are rarely
experienced until the disease is pretty well established, and are very
exhausting.</p>

<p><i>Hectic Fever</i> generally occurs soon after the pulmonary symptoms
are developed, and increases in intensity with the progress of the disease.
There are usually two paroxysms in twenty-four hours, one of which occurs
towards evening and is followed by night-sweats.</p>

<p><i>Dyspnoea</i> (difficult breathing) is at first slight, except after
exertion, amounting to only a sense of oppression; but it becomes more and
more severe as the disease advances, until the very last, when it is
agonizing in the extreme.</p>

<p><i>Aphth&aelig;</i>, sometimes extending to the pharynx and larynx, generally
occurs towards the last. The mouth and throat become so very sore and
tender that nourishment and medicine are taken with difficulty.</p>

<p><i>Emaciation and Debility</i> are characteristic of the disease. They
fluctuate as the disease advances or is retarded, increasing to the very
last.</p>

<p><i>Auscultation and Percussion</i> constitute valuable means of
diagnosis from the time tubercular matter begins to be deposited to the
very last, and, when correctly practiced, reveal the extent and progress of
the disease. As a knowledge of the sounds elicited can only be acquired by
practical experience with proper instruments, they will not <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503"></a>[pg 503]</span>be
described here. The only diseases with which consumption is likely to be
confounded are general debility in the early stage, bronchitis, chronic
pleurisy, chronic pneumonia, and abscess in the lungs, after the advent of
pulmonary symptoms.</p>

<p><b>Curability</b>. Notwithstanding the prevailing opinion that
consumption is incurable, there exists ample, incontrovertible evidence to
the contrary. Its curability is established beyond the shadow of a doubt.
Individuals have recovered in whom there was extensive destruction of
pulmonary tissue, and, indeed, entire destruction of one lung. Numerous
instances are on record in which persons have suffered from all the
symptoms of confirmed consumption, and have regained their health and
subsequently died of other diseases. The case of the late Dr. Joseph
Parish, of Philadelphia, affords a striking example of this kind. In early
life, he manifested all the symptoms of confirmed consumption, including
frequent hemorrhages, yet he fully regained his health, and, after a very
useful life, died at an advanced age of another disease. Post-mortem
examination revealed the existence of cicatrices, or scars, in his lungs
where tubercular matter had been deposited. Dr. Wood, in his Practice of
Medicine, mentions another instance of a medical gentleman in Philadelphia,
who in early life suffered from consumption with h&aelig;moptysis, from which he
recovered, and afterwards died, at an advanced age, of typhoid fever, when
the knife revealed the presence of cicatrices. Post-mortem examinations of
individuals who have died of other diseases, have revealed, in numerous
instances, the presence of consumption at some period of their existence.
In these cases the lungs were perfectly healed by cicatrization, or by the
deposit of a chalky material. A French physician made post-mortem
examinations of one hundred women, all of whom were over sixty years of
age, and who had died of other diseases, and in fifty of them he found
evidences of the previous existence of consumption.</p>

<p>Professor Flint says that consumption sometimes terminates in recovery,
and that his observations lead him to the conclusion that the prospect of
recovery is more favorable in cases characterized by frequent hemorrhages.
Drs. Ware and Walshe are also led to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>Professor J. Hughes Bennett, of Edinburgh, has thoroughly investigated
the subject, and adds his testimony to that of others, citing numerous
cases that have resulted in perfect recovery. If such testimony is not
sufficient, we may mention the following, whose names are well known and
respected in professional circles, and all of whom declare that consumption
is a curable disease. The list includes Laennec, Andral, Cruveilhier,
Kingston, Presat, Rog&eacute;e, Boudet, and a host of others.</p>

<p>No farther back than 1866, on page 145, of the proceedings of the
Connecticut Medical Society, we find "Observations, Ante-mortem and
Post-mortem, upon the case of the late President Day by Prof. S.G. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504"></a>[pg
504]</span>Hubbard, M.D., New Haven," from which we learn that Jeremiah
Day, LL. D., who was for twenty-nine years President of Yale College, was,
while a mere youth, a victim of pulmonary consumption. During his infancy
and boyhood his vitality was feeble. He entered Yale College as a student
in 1789, "but was soon obliged to leave the institution on account of
pulmonary difficulty, which was doubtless the incipient stage of the
organic disease of the lungs which subsequently developed itself." He
remained in feeble health for two years, but returned to college, and
graduated in 1797. For the next six years his lung difficulties were quite
severe, and he repeatedly bled in large quantities, but he had so far
recovered in 1803, as to accept a Professorship. He was afterwards chosen
President of the college, which office he held for many years, in the
enjoyment of good health. He died from "old age," as we are told, in 1867,
aged 94 years.</p>

<p>Statistics show that under the improved methods of treating this
disease, the mortality, as compared with previous years, has been greatly
reduced. Clinical observation proves that injuries to the lungs are not so
fatal as was once supposed.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The earlier the treatment of this disease is
undertaken, the greater is the probability of success. The reason of this
is obvious; at first the disease is general or constitutional, but as it
advances, by the deposit of <i>tubercular matter</i>, it becomes both
constitutional and local. Hence the treatment must be both <i>general</i>
and <i>local</i>. The occurrence of certain prominent and distressing
symptoms, either from the natural progress of the disease, or from
complications with other affections, often renders it difficult, even for
physicians, to determine how far their treatment should be general and how
far local.</p>

<p>Treating the symptoms instead of the general disease, or treating the
constitutional disease without regard to the symptoms which arise from it,
is an error into which many physicians have fallen. The constitutional
affection, the local manifestations and complications, and the
circumstances and individual peculiarities of the patient, must all be
carefully considered; bearing in mind all the while, that tubercular matter
is the product of a morbid action, which, in every case, must exist before
its deposition in the lungs, or any other tissue, can take place.</p>

<p>In every case in which curative treatment is to be instituted, the
hearty and persistent co-operation of both patient and friends is
absolutely necessary; and the treatment, which is both hygienic and medical
in character, should have in view the following aims:</p>

<p>(1.) The avoidance of the causes concerned in the production and
perpetuation of the disease.</p>

<p>(2.) The restoration of healthy nutrition, in order to stop the
formation of tuberculous matter.</p>

<p>(3.) The arrest of the abnormal breaking down of the tissues, and the
prevention of emaciation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505"></a>[pg
505]</span>(4.) The relief of local symptoms, and the complications arising
from other diseases.</p>

<p>The fulfillment of the first indication, the avoidance of causes, is of
the utmost importance, for if they have been sufficient to <i>produce</i>
the disease, their continued operation must certainly be sufficient to
<i>perpetuate</i> it. A single individual is very often subjected to the
operation of several of the causes already enumerated, some of which, in
consequence of circumstances and surroundings, are unavoidable. Of these,
the one most difficult to overcome is climate; <i>i.e.</i> the frequent
variations of temperature.</p>

<p>Upon the subject of climate much has been written. But that which is
best adapted to the cure of consumption, is that which will enable the
patient to pass a certain number of hours every day in the pure open air,
without exposure to sudden alterations of temperature. There are very few
persons who change their place of residence, except as a last resort, when
the disease is in the last stage. It is then productive of little or no
good. This is one reason why so many people having consumption die in
Florida, and other warm countries. If a change of climate is to be effected
at all, it should be made early.</p>

<p>The most powerful stimulant to health is well-regulated exercise. It
assists the performance of every function, and is of paramount importance
to promote good digestion and proper assimilation, conditions essential for
recovery. It should not, however, be carried beyond the powers of endurance
of the individual, so as to exhaust or fatigue. Everything that can
invigorate should be adopted; everything that exhausts should be
shunned.</p>

<p>To fulfill the second indication, to restore healthy nutrition, requires
not only a proper diet, both as regards quantity and quality, but demands
that the integrity of the organs concerned in the process of digestion and
assimilation, shall be maintained at the highest standard of perfection
possible.</p>

<p>That the diet be sufficient in quantity should be obvious to all. It is
also necessary that it be nutritious, and that it should contain
carbonaceous elements. Food of a starchy or saccharine character is apt to
increase acidity, and interfere with the assimilation of other elements,
therefore, articles, rich in fatty matters, should enter largely into the
diet. The articles of food best adapted to the consumptive invalid are
milk, rich cream, eggs, bread made from unbolted wheat-flour, and raised
with yeast, cracked wheat, oatmeal, good butter, beef, game, and fowls.
These contain the necessary elements for assimilation. Oily food is of
great importance, and the beef eaten should contain a good proportion of
fat. Plenty of salt should always be eaten with the food, and a desire for
it is often experienced. Over-eating should be avoided, lest the stomach be
induced to rebel against articles of diet rich in important elements.</p>

<p>Derangement of the process of nutrition requires careful attention,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506"></a>[pg
506]</span>and, if necessary, correction. For this purpose, nothing can
excel Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. It increases the appetite,
favors the nutritive transformation of the food, enriches the blood, and
thus retards the deposition of tubercular matter. It is so combined that,
while it meets all these indications, it relieves or prevents the
development of those distressing symptoms so common in this disease.</p>

<p>The "Golden Medical Discovery" is adapted to fulfill the third
indication in the management of this disease, which is to check the
abnormal breaking down and waste of tissues, which constitute such a
prominent feature in this malady. The antiseptic properties of the
"Discovery" are unmistakably manifested in preventing such abnormal
decomposition. The emaciation, excessive expectoration, profuse
perspiration, diarrhea, and hectic fever, common to consumption, are all
due to a too rapid disintegration and waste of the tissues. It is in this
condition of the system that this medicine, by its powerful antiseptic
properties, manifests its most wonderful curative ability. When, as in this
disease, the vital forces of the system have, in a degree, lost their
restraining influence over the processes of disintegration, waste, and
decay, which goes on so rapidly that nutrition cannot compensate for the
loss to the system, then it is that the "Golden Medical Discovery," by its
antiseptic influence, checks this rapid waste of the tissues, and thus
arrests the disease. To the lack of employment of such a remedy in the
treatment of consumption, the unparalleled fatality of the disease is
largely due. In their anxiety to improve digestion and nutrition, and thus
build up the tissues, physicians often lose sight of the no less important
indication of restraining the destructive waste going on in the system,
which overbalances the supplies furnished by absorption. The gradually
increasing emaciation and loss of strength render perpetuity of the
organism impossible.</p>

<p>The fulfillment of the fourth indication, to relieve local symptoms, and
the complications with other diseases, is often attended with no little
difficulty.</p>

<p><i>The Cough</i> is a secondary symptom, arising from the irritation
caused by the tubercular deposits. Medicated inhalations may give temporary
relief, but cannot cure it. They strike at the branches of the disease,
while the root is left to flourish and develop new branches.</p>

<p>Expectorants have been employed to a great extent, and the theories,
which have been advanced in favor of their use, are sometimes very
ingenious. That they modify the cough, we do not attempt to deny; but it is
usually at a great expense, for they derange the stomach and interfere with
digestion and assimilation.</p>

<p>Improvement of the general health is always attended with amelioration
of the cough. If the patient did not cough at all, the lungs would soon
fill up with broken-down tissue, and death from suffocation would result.
Irritation of the nerves supplying the lungs sometimes occurs, and causes
the patient to cough immoderately, when it is <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_507" id="Page_507"></a>[pg 507]</span>not necessary for the
purpose of expectoration. This condition is readily controlled by Dr.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, which exerts a decidedly quieting and
tonic influence upon the pneumogastric nerve, which, with its
ramifications, is the one involved. An infusion of the common red clover,
in tablespoonful doses, will also be found a valuable adjunct in overcoming
this condition.</p>

<p><i>Hoemoptysis</i>. Hemorrhage from the lungs is generally sudden and
unexpected in its attack, though sometimes preceded by difficulty of
breathing, and a salty taste in the mouth. Although it <i>very rarely</i>
destroys life, it often occasions alarm. Common table salt, given in
one-fourth to one-half teaspoonful doses, repeated every ten or fifteen
minutes, is generally sufficient to control it. Ligatures applied to the
thighs and arms, sufficiently tight to arrest the circulation of blood in
the veins, but not tight enough to impede it in the arteries, is a useful
proceeding. Ergot, in teaspoonful doses of the fluid extract, hamamelis,
and gallic acid, all are valuable for this purpose.</p>

<p><i>Night-sweats</i> can only be regarded as a symptom of weakness, and
are to be remedied by an improvement of the general health. Bathing in salt
water is sometimes attended with good results. The practice of giving acids
for this symptom can only be regarded as irrational. It may arrest the
sweating, but it will do harm in other ways. Belladonna, given at bed-time,
is an effectual remedy.</p>

<p><i>Frequency of the pulse</i> is generally a prominent symptom in this
disease. It sometimes points to a condition of sufficient importance to
require a remedy. Although the "Golden Medical Discovery" is combined to
meet this condition, its value may be greatly enhanced by adding one-half
to one teaspoonful, according to the urgency of the case and the frequency
of the pulse, of the fluid extract of <i>Veratrum Viride</i> to each
bottle. The benefit of this, when persisted in, will be apparent in the
amelioration of all the symptoms, and in the general improvement. This
fluid extract can be had at any drug store.</p>

<p><i>Diarrhea</i> is sometimes a troublesome symptom, and particularly so
in the latter stages of the disease. It is generally due to acidity of the
alimentary canal, to which the treatment must be directed. Great care
should be taken in the selection of the diet to improve the quality and
avoid everything which disagrees with the patient. Improve digestion by
every possible means. Carbonate of soda and rhubarb, in the form of a
syrup, are sometimes excellent. The Compound Extract of Smart-weed, in
small doses, will generally diminish the frequency of the discharges.</p>

<p><i>Derangement of the Liver</i> is often a complication requiring
attention, and the timely relief of which goes very far in ameliorating the
general condition of the patient. The "Golden Medical Discovery" is
generally sufficient to relieve this complication. Its influence, however,
may be considerably increased in this direction by the use of Dr. Pierce's
Pleasant Pellets, according to the directions which accompany <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508"></a>[pg 508]</span>them.
They should only be taken in the smallest doses, one or two "Pellets" every
day, just enough to produce a natural movement of the bowels each day.</p>

<p><i>Uterine Derangements</i>. In the female, derangement of the menstrual
function is generally an early complication of consumption, if indeed it
does not occur at the outset. It deserves early attention, and, in addition
to the remedies already advised, Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription is so
compounded as to meet the requirements of this condition, and at the same
time exert a favorable influence upon the constitutional disease.</p>

<p>The numerous reports of cures of well-developed cases of Consumption to
be found in the back portion of this little treatise must be sufficient, it
seems to us, to convince the most skeptical of the wonderful power which
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery exercises over this terribly fatal
malady. As will be noted, many of the cases there reported had long been
unsuccessfully treated with cod liver oil emulsion and all the other usual
remedies employed by the profession and were fast running down. "Golden
Medical Discovery" aroused the stomach and liver, and started all the
nutritive functions into action, whereby digestion and nutrition were
promoted and both the strength and flesh steadily built up. The reader will
bear in mind, that most of the cases hereinafter reported, were pronounced
Consumption by their attending physicians as well as by us. It cannot be
said, therefore, that we exaggerate the malady and that the cases were
merely bad, lingering coughs. Thousands, whose maladies have been
pronounced genuine Tubercular Pulmonary Consumption, (Phthisis Pulmonalis)
by eminent physicians have been <i>perfectly</i> and <i>permanently</i>
cured by the use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. It can,
therefore, no longer be doubted that this wonderful compound is far
superior as a remedy for Consumption to cod liver oil, compound
Hypophosphites, and the many other agents so highly extolled, and so
generally prescribed for this fatal malady by even the more progressive and
advanced of the medical profession of our day. Read the letters received
from grateful patients who have been cured and note how many commend the
use of "Golden Medical Discovery," as a "last resort," after their home
physicians had exhausted all their skill and resources in vain.</p>

<h2>CHRONIC BRONCHITIS.</h2>


<p>This is a subacute or chronic form of inflammation of the mucous
membrane of the bronchial tubes, of a very persistent character and
variable intensity. There are few diseases which manifest a greater variety
of modifications than this.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The symptoms of this disease vary greatly with its
violence and progress. Cough is always present, and is very often the first
symptom to attract the patient's attention. It is usually increased by
every slight cold, and with each fresh accession becomes more and more
severe, and is arrested with greater difficulty. The cough is always
persistent, sometimes short and hacking, at other times deep, prolonged,
and harsh. Sometimes it is spasmodic and irritating and particularly so
when it is associated with affections of the larynx, or with asthma,
involving irritation of the branches or the filaments of the pneumogastric
nerve.</p>

<p>When the chronic follows the acute form of the disease, or follows
inflammation of the lungs, the expectoration may be profuse from the first,
and of a yellowish color and tenacious character. When the disease arises
from other causes, the expectoration is generally slight at first, and the
cough dry or hacking. This may continue some time before much expectoration
occurs. The expectorated matter is at first whitish, opaque, and tenacious,
mixed sometimes with a frothy mucus, requiring considerable coughing to
loosen it and throw it off. As the disease progresses, it becomes thicker,
more sticky, of a yellowish or greenish color, mixed with pus, and
sometimes streaked with blood. In the latter stages, it becomes profuse and
fetid, and severe hemorrhage may occur. Sometimes the cough and
expectoration disappear when the weather becomes warm, to appear again with
the return of winter, which has gained for it the appellation of <i>winter
cough</i>. The sufferers feel as if something was bound tightly round them,
rendering inhalation difficult. Soreness throughout the chest is often a
persistent symptom, especially when the cough is dry and hard. Behind the
breast-bone there is experienced a sense of uneasiness, in some cases
amounting to pain, more or less severe.</p>

<p>As the disease progresses, the loss of strength is more and more marked,
the patient can no longer follow his usual employment, his spirits are
depressed, and he gradually sinks, or tubercular matter is deposited in the
lungs, and consumption is developed.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. Thorough attention to hygiene, with the avoidance of
the causes concerned in the production and perpetuation of the disease, is
necessary. The patient must be protected from the vicissitudes of the
weather by plenty of clothing; flannel should be worn next to the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510"></a>[pg 510]</span>skin,
with a pad of flannel or buckskin over the chest, and the feet should be
kept warm and dry. Exercise in the open air is essential. When the weather
is so cold as to excite coughing, something should be worn over the mouth,
as a thin cloth, handkerchief, muffler, or anything which will modify the
temperature of the atmosphere before it comes into contact with the mucous
lining of the lungs. Good ventilation of sleeping-rooms is all-important;
not that the air should be cold, but that it should be as pure as
possible.</p>

<p>The diet must be nutritious, cabonaceous, and of sufficient quantity.
Beef, milk, rich cream, plenty of good butter, eggs, fish, wheat bread from
unbolted flour, supply the appropriate alimentary substances for perfect
nutrition and the maintenance of animal heat.</p>

<p>To overcome the modified form of inflammation in the bronchial tubes,
all sources of irritation should be avoided, as the inhalation of dust, or
excessively cold air. It is in the cure of severe and obstinate cases of
this disease that Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery has achieved
unparalleled success, and won the highest praise from those who have used
it. Its value will generally be enhanced in treating this complaint by
adding one-half a teaspoonful of the fluid extract of <i>Veratrum
Viride</i> to each bottle. This can be added by any respectable druggist.
Especially should it be thus modified if the pulse be accelerated so as to
beat ninety or a hundred times in a minute. The "Golden Medical Discovery"
should be taken in teaspoonful doses, repeated every two hours. When the
cough is dry and hard, with no expectoration, it arises from irritation of
some of the branches of the pneumogastric nerve, which this remedy will
relieve. It may, however, be aided by inhaling the hot vapor of vinegar and
water, or vapor from a decoction of hops, to which vinegar has been
added.</p>

<p>The use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery should be
<i>persisted</i> in, taking it in frequent doses, every two or three hours,
and keeping up its use until the disease yields and is perfectly stamped
out. Do not expect a formidable disease of perhaps weeks' or months'
duration to be <i>speedily</i> cured. Chronic diseases are generally slow
in their inception and development and can only be cured by gradual stages.
Perseverance in treatment is required. Many invalids do not possess the
strength of purpose&mdash;the will power&mdash;to continue the use of the "Golden
Medical Discovery" long enough to receive its full benefits. It is worse
than useless for such to commence its use, for without persistency it
cannot be expected to cure such obstinate maladies as chronic
bronchitis.</p>

<h2>ASTHMA.</h2>

<h4>PHTHISIC.</h4>


<p>One of the most distressing ailments with which the human family is
afflicted is asthma. Its symptoms are not to be mistaken. Suddenly and
without apparent provocation the patient experiences the greatest
difficulty in breathing. When warning is given, there is usually a sense of
fullness in the stomach, flatulence, languor, and general nervous
irritability. The countenance is a picture of anxiety and horror. The
difficulty of breathing increases and the struggle for air commences.
Windows and doors are thrown open, fans used, and, utterly regardless of
consequences, the sufferer passes the whole night in exposure and torture,
even though the temperature be below zero. Fearing suffocation, the patient
dare not lie down; he rushes to the window for air, rests his head upon a
table or chair, or upon his hands, with the elbows upon the knees, jumps up
suddenly and gasps and struggles for air. The eyes are prominent and the
veins of the forehead distended with blood; sometimes the bowels are
relaxed. The urine is colorless and is passed in copious quantities. This
symptom indicates great excitement of the nervous system. The voice is
hoarse, articulation difficult, breathing limited, noisy and wheezy. The
<i>wheezing</i> is pathognomonic of the disease. It can only be confounded
with croup, and then only in the young. In croup there is pain and
difficulty in swallowing, fever and cough, which are usually absent in
asthma. A severe paroxysm of asthma is very distressing to witness, and one
unused to it might well suppose the sufferer to be in his last agonies. No
definite limit can be assigned to the duration of the attack or of the
disease. It may last but a few minutes, may endure for hours, or with
slight remission continue for days. The condition of the patient may be for
years as changeable as the pointings of the weather-vane. In fact, the
atmosphere has much to do with the disease. With every approaching storm,
with every cloud of dust, even the dust from sweeping a room, with every
foul odor, and, in some more sensitive organizations, with even the perfume
of flowers, a paroxysm is provoked. Truly he is a "child of circumstances,"
a veritable football upon the toes of every atmospheric disturbance.</p>


<h4>UNPARALLELED SUCCESS.</h4>


<p>Persons affected with asthma or phthisic are numerous. With such an
amount of suffering in our midst is it not a marvel, if not a disgrace,
that the medical profession of to-day endorse the opinions of a half
century ago and pronounce it incurable, rather than make stupendous and
laudable efforts to discover plans of medication that will <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512"></a>[pg 512]</span>result
in certain and permanent cure? Almost single handed we undertook this field
of investigation, and we take pleasure in reporting that our labors have
been crowned with success. The large experience furnished us has led to the
discovery of remedies for this distressing malady of more than ordinary
efficacy. Through the agency of these means we have been enabled to cure
hundreds, who had suffered untold tortures for twelve, fifteen, or
twenty-five years. Some whom we have been successful in curing had suffered
from childhood to middle and even old age. The treatment of asthma, or
phthisic, still continues to be a prominent specialty at the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute.</p>


<h4>NATURE OF THE DISEASE.</h4>


<p>As to the exact pathological condition in this malady, opinions differ.
Some physicians consider it a disease of the nervous system, others, of the
blood, others, of the bronchial tubes, while not a few believe it to be
dependent upon some disease of the stomach, heart, liver, kidneys, or due
to urinary affections, or "female weakness." Respecting all these diseases
of special organs, it is evident that any complication, and particularly
one that is debilitating or causes irritation of the nervous system will
increase its severity. This important fact we keep constantly in view in
our treatment, and prescribe remedies to remove all complications.</p>

<p>In heart disease there is often dyspnoea, or difficult breathing, but
this is not of the nature of asthma, or phthisic. The condition of the
lungs is readily understood. There being an obstruction to the free passage
of the blood through the heart, any excessive muscular exertion, or
anything, in fact, which increases the action of the heart, is very apt to
produce congestion of the lungs, and then the blood becomes surcharged with
carbonic acid, which causes increased efforts to take more air into the
lungs.</p>

<p><b>A Nervous Disease</b>. A sudden fright, unfavorable news, grief, loss
of property, etc., circumstances which affect the mind and nervous system,
almost invariably throw the phthisical into a paroxysm. Nervines are
demanded, particularly if the case be a chronic one, and we see that they
are carefully and properly prepared and supplied, and in such a form as to
be exactly fitted to the temperament and constitution.</p>


<h4>POPULAR REMEDIES USED FOR SELF-TREATMENT OF ASTHMA.</h4>


<p>There are numerous remedies that may be used to <i>relieve paroxysms</i>
of asthma. Among them we will notice a few that are most frequently
employed by the profession. They can be easily and inexpensively prepared
by any patient or druggist:</p>

<p>1. Equal parts of the tinctures of lobalis capsicum and skunk <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513"></a>[pg 513]</span>cabbage
root. <i>Dose</i>.&mdash;Take a half teaspoonful in a little water every ten or
fifteen minutes until relieved.</p>

<p>NOTE.&mdash;This is an antispasmodic and relaxant. In considerable quantities
it will produce sickness at the stomach and perhaps vomiting. It should not
be used when there is disease of the heart.</p>

<p>2. Chloroform. <i>Dose</i>.&mdash;A small quantity (say thirty drops), may be
poured upon a handkerchief or napkin, held about one inch from the nostrils
and the vapor inhaled. It is quite unnecessary to use this until
insensibility follows; in fact, such an effect would be hazardous to life
in the hands of the inexperienced.</p>

<p>3. Sulphuric ether. <i>Dose</i>.&mdash;The same as No. 2, and with the same
precaution. Either of them should be used promptly upon the beginning of
the paroxysm.</p>

<p>4. Take four ounces of stramonium leaves and strip from the stems,
rubbing between the hands to partly pulverize. To this add one ounce of
saltpetre, finely powdered. <i>Dose</i>.&mdash;Place a half teaspoonful upon a
very hot shovel. Inhale the rising smoke. If the first few inspirations
cause coughing, the smoke should not be evaded as the coughing incites
deeper inspiration.</p>

<p>5. Stramonium and saltpetre as in No. 4. Dampen with water and make into
balls or cones. These are more easily handled and are fired in the same way
as the powder and used in the same way.</p>

<p>6. Take of sunflower leaves, stramonium leaves, mullein leaves, one
ounce each; of lobelia leaves, half an ounce; of powdered nitre, one ounce;
and benzoic acid, two drams. Mix thoroughly. <i>Dose</i>.&mdash;A pipeful, to be
smoked the same as tobacco.</p>

<p>7. A cup of hot coffee or several of hot water. This is especially
effective in cases arising from checked perspiration, from rheumatism,
etc.</p>

<p>These recipes are given to the public as being the principal agents
employed by the medical profession throughout the world. It must be
distinctly understood that they are not <i>curative</i> but merely
<i>palliative</i>, and used to relieve paroxysms. We object to them wholly
and unqualifiedly because they contain NARCOTICS. It is a fundamental
principle in our treatment not to use this class of remedies. They stupefy
the brain, debilitate the nervous system, and have, in not a few instances,
formed an unfortunate appetite and habit, most difficult to overcome. We
are of the opinion that one of the chief reasons why this malady has been
considered incurable is the fact that physicians have almost universally
relied upon narcotic drugs. With such medication a cure is the exception. A
cure can only be effected under such circumstances when the <i>powers of
nature are sufficient to overcome both the</i> NARCOTIC <i>and the</i>
DISEASE. That they will <i>relieve</i> we do not deny, but <i>they will
never cure</i>. It reminds us of an old country doctor who advised a lady
to smoke tobacco to cure acid dyspepsia. She followed the prescription for
over thirty years and at last accounts was not cured <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514"></a>[pg 514]</span>yet. In
all seriousness we ask would any other remedy except a narcotic or
stimulant be used with such persistency for anything like this length of
time? Is it not apparent that such agents form a habit which is often worse
than the disease, and yet fail to effect a cure? We appreciate the
necessity for relief, and do not blame sufferers for availing themselves of
any means for this purpose. But they should not be satisfied with relief
only, but should look about for such a system of medication as will rid
them of the disease completely and permanently. If a week's or a month's
exemption is a "foretaste of heaven," how incomparable are the comforts and
happiness to be derived from a life-time immunity?</p>


<h4>MILLIONS OF DOLLARS</h4>


<p>are annually spent upon the advice of physicians, in traveling expenses,
and hotel bills, by sufferers from asthma, or phthisic, in seeking a change
of climate that will be advantageous. It is the last expedient of the
doctor who is annoyed by the continued complaint of his unrelieved patient,
and can only be made available by the wealthy. In some instances the change
is beneficial, but to be effectually so a permanent change of residence is
required. Most patients are unable or unwilling to do this. In some cases
change only affords temporary relief, the attacks returning after a few
months. Even the wealthy dislike to take such chances. The less opulent
cannot think of such methods, and hence are compelled to bear their
sufferings as best they can. In the majority of instances the "change of
climate" is only an illusion, or only temporarily beneficial at best. We
can tell them a better way, and if they are wise they will follow it.</p>

<hr />


<h3>HAY ASTHMA, OR HAY FEVER.</h3>


<p>This affection, known also as Hay Catarrh, Hay Fever, or Rose Cold
differs but little in its manifestations, from coryza, or cold in the head,
save in its <i>inciting cause</i>, and in its element of periodicity. In
this latitude there are persons who, during summer or early fall, are
invariably attacked with acute congestion or inflammation of the upper
air-passages, giving rise to sneezing, watery discharges from the nose and
eyes, difficult respiration, fever, and general prostration. These symptoms
are supposed to be induced by the inhalation of pollen or odors from
grasses or flowers, which at that time are supposed to give off certain
exhalations of an Irritating character. Unless arrested by medical
treatment, the disease lasts until cool weather, or the occurrence of a
hard frost rids the atmosphere of the exciting influence.</p>

<p>Some feather beds give off an odor which excites all the aggravated
symptoms of this disease. Thus it appears that certain emanations <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515"></a>[pg 515]</span>have
the power of inciting these inflammatory conditions in certain sensitive
constitutions. In all individuals suffering from this disease there is an
over sensitiveness of the nervous system which admits of the appearance of
such sudden and severe manifestations. Many cases suffering only mild
symptoms for the first few seasons, annually become aggravated until severe
spasmodic asthma is a regular, and sometimes continuous complication. A
case or two are on record in which the odor from the body of a horse so
induced these symptoms that the individual could never ride or drive
him.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In mild cases, or when the attack first appears, the
daily use of Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy fluid will neutralize and wash away
the poisonous particles which have found lodgment in the nasal passages.
The Remedy is best applied with Dr. Pierce's Nasal Douche. When the disease
has existed the previous season it is necessary that the patient begin both
constitutional and local treatment four or six weeks prior to an expected
return of the disease. The nervous system should be strengthened, and the
resistance of the patient to the irritating influence of these pollens and
odors so increased, that even though he may be exposed, no severe symptoms
will follow.</p>

<p>Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery will be found invaluable as an
alterative, blood purifier, and nerve tonic, and should be taken regularly
while Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy is being used locally for its antiseptic
and curative properties. The action of the "Discovery" is especially
desired in cases that are so far advanced as to be attended with asthmatic
symptoms, such as difficult breathing, headache, and a feeling of lassitude
and prostration.</p>

<p>In very obstinate or distressing cases our specialists have been able to
prescribe and send, by mail or express, special courses of treatment which
have proven so effective as to cure the disease <i>permanently</i>, so that
it has not reappeared the following season. The treatment seems to have
produced such an impression upon the system as to have fortified the
individual against a return of the disease.</p>

<p>In rare cases morbid growths in the upper air-passages are of such a
nature as in themselves to be a source of sufficient excitement to
unbalance the nervous equilibrium so that the individual is thus rendered
more susceptible to this disease. In such, or exceedingly obstinate cases a
personal examination by our specialist is desirable, and often results in
the use of such measures as give permanent relief.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I wish to say to you that Doctor Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery saved my life and has made me a man; my home-physician
says I am good for forty years yet. You will remember that my case was a
case just between life and death, and all of my friends were sure it was a
case of death, until I commenced taking a second bottle of "Golden Medical
Discovery," when I was able to sit up and the cough was very much better,
and the bleeding from my lungs stopped, and before I had taken six bottles
of the "Golden Medical Discovery" my cough ceased and I was a new man and
ready for business.</p>

<p>And now I feel that it is a duty that I owe to my fellow-men to
recommend to them the "Golden Medical Discovery" and Dr. Sage's Catarrh
Remedy, which saved my life when doctors and all kinds of medicines failed
to do me any good.</p>

<p>I will send to you with this letter two of my photographs; one was taken
a few weeks before I was taken down sick in bed, and the other was taken
after I was well.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I can gladly recommend Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery to all suffering from diseases for which you recommend it. In the
summer of 1888 I took a severe cold, which settled on my lungs and chest,
and I suffered intensely with it. I tried several of our best physicians
here and they gave up all hopes of my recovery, and my friends thought I
would have to die, and I thought so myself, as the doctors did not know
what was the matter with me. In the morning, on rising, I would cough and
spit blood for two hours, and I was pale and weak and not able to work any.
I then ran across Dr. Pierce's advertisement and I came to the conclusion I
would try the "Golden Medical Discovery," as it was so highly recommended.
I was greatly discouraged when I began the use of the "Discovery," but
after I had taken four or five bottles I then noticed I was getting better,
and I could stand it to work some, and kept on taking it till I took about
twenty or twenty-five bottles. It has been five years since I took it and
have had no return of that trouble since. I gladly recommend your medicine
for I know it saved my life.</p>

disease. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery cured her.</p>

<p>When her case was reported to the specialist of the Invalids' Hotel,
Mrs. McGill was suffering from pain in the chest, struggling for breath,
hard dry cough; jarring hurt the chest; short breath, backache; uterine
disease, leucorrhea, menstruation scanty and painful; feet and ankles
swollen; was confined to house most of the time; was given up by her home
physician. Her disease began six years before with "lung disease" which was
followed by bleeding from lungs.</p>


<p><b>CURES WHEN COD LIVER OIL FAILS.</b></p>

<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;My wife a few years ago had hemorrhages of the lungs,
and we summoned our home physician. He checked the hemorrhage but failed to
cure her. She had also a terrible cough and expectorated a great deal. She
wanted to see another doctor so I called one and he examined her. She asked
him whether she had consumption, and his answer was, "Madam, it is very
near consumption." He advised her to use cod liver oil, but this gave but
little relief. I happened to get hold of one of your little books that
comes with each bottle of Dr. Pierce's medicines and I read some cases
about like my wife's. I went to the drug store and procured a bottle of Dr.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and my wife commenced using it according
to directions. She began to get better right away and her cough has left
her. She used about ten bottles. She is in her fifty-fifth year and can
walk ten or twelve miles without any trouble. We are satisfied that her
life and health have been saved by the use of "Golden Medical Discovery."
As soon as she takes any cold she insists upon having a bottle of her
medicine, as she calls it, and that is the last we hear of her cold.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I have long felt it my duty to acknowledge to you what
your "Golden Medical Discovery" and "Pleasant Pellets" have done for me.
They almost raised me from the grave. I had three brothers and one sister
die of consumption, and I was speedily following after them. I had severe
cough, pain, copious expectoration, and other alarming symptoms, and my
friends all thought I had but a few months to live. At this time I was
persuaded to try your "Discovery," and the first bottle acted like magic.
Of course I continued on with the medicine, and as a result I gained
rapidly in strength. My friends were astonished. When I commenced the use
of your medicines, six years ago, I weighed but 120 and was sinking
rapidly. I now weigh 135, and my health continues perfect. I have a copy of
your "People's Common Sense Medical Adviser," and neither money nor friends
could ever induce me to part with it.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;In 1872, when living in New York State, my health was
very poor. I was clear "run down." Pain in my lungs, right side and in my
bowels; had been ailing for nearly two years; my feet swelled during the
day so I could hardly stand it till night, as I was on my feet the most of
the time.</p>

<p>I wrote you and you sent me special medicines, which brought me around
all right. I have weak lungs, and when I get run down I usually take a few
bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, which always builds me
up. We have used your "Discovery" in our family with the best results.</p>

<p>When living at Blue Mound I was very sick with inflammation of the lungs
from taking cold. When I took cold I was at Clinton, Missouri. Was confined
to my bed for a few days. I said to the doctor that I must go home; he
advised me to stay where I was, but I started for Blue Mound with my pulse
at 140. When I arrived home I was glad to get in bed, and called in Dr.
&mdash;&mdash;. He said my lungs were in a bad condition. Well, I was very sick for
three weeks or more, and when I got around I was not well, and at that time
Dr. &mdash;&mdash; came to Blue Mound, stopped there two weeks, gave free lectures
and had lots of patients. He examined me and said I needed treatment, and
he could cure me.</p>

<p>I was suffering all the time with pain in my right lung. He wanted
$50.00 for treatment, and would cure. So I let him pass along and wrote to
your Association for advice, which was to take the "Discovery," and I took
one-half dozen bottles which "filled the bill." Yours respectfully,</p>

dyspepsia, also nasal catarrh, and got so bad and weak that I could not

stomach and a burning sensation coming into the throat. I took Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery and "Pleasant Pellets," and can truly say these
medicines have helped me wonderfully. I improved right along from the very
beginning. I stopped taking medicine in the latter part of May and then
felt as well as ever in my life. I am pretty well now, for a man of
sixty-three years. I can eat all kinds of food and it doesn't cause me any
pain in the stomach as it always did before I took Dr. Pierce's medicines.
I can cheerfully say to the public that they need not hesitate in taking
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery for dyspepsia; it will eradicate and
cure the disease if anything will.</p>

trying for relief in different directions without success, I was induced to
apply to your eminent Staff of Physicians at 603 Main St., Buffalo, N.Y.,

has been continuous, until I now feel my lungs are entirely cured; have no

understand that there was no hope for my cure. Your advertisements fell

the insight you so ably explained, so I was satisfied you understood your
profession well. I started full of hope and as I reached Buffalo, after
three days' travel by rail, some 1,500 miles, there was something that
cheered me on. I made my way to your Invalids' Hotel. I was examined and
pronounced curable. I was operated upon for a local affection that caused
much of my suffering, the same day I arrived, and in ten days was
discharged permanently cured. I have felt perfectly well ever since. I was
nicely treated by the able nurses and attendants who were always gentle and
kind.</p>

I visited your Institution in 1889, completely broken down in health and

money with many of our home physicians, but they only gave me partial
relief and I would soon be worse than ever. When I spoke of coming to you,
the doctors here cried "humbug," but I told them I had been humbugged at
home and if I staid I would surely die, and if I went could do no worse. I
spent thirty days at your Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, and came
away like a new man, comparatively speaking. I found the Institution all it
had been represented, and I may truthfully say, that the time spent there
was to me as an oasis in a desert to a weary and thirsty traveler; for
those were among the happiest days of my life. No pains were spared to make
each patient comfortable and at home. I cannot recommend your Institution
too highly, for I feel that to your treatment I owe my life. I have sold a

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I had been confined to my bed four months, had tried
the skill of four doctors and all the patent medicines that were
recommended for my case, which was an abscess on the lung. My physicians
and friends had given me up to die; I was reduced to a perfect skeleton; my
strength was gone; my eyesight was so dim I could scarcely see at all, and
I had no appetite&mdash;could not eat anything at all when I commenced using
Doctor Pierce's Family Medicines. I have taken sixteen bottles of the
"Golden Medical Discovery," twelve bottles of "Pellets" and three bottles
of "Favorite Prescription," and to-day I am well and strong and weigh 128
pounds&mdash;two pounds more than I ever before weighed in my life.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;My daughter had pneumonia and it left her with a
horrible cough and one lung was almost gone; our doctor seemed to think
there could be nothing more done, and said to go South; but not having the
means at that time, I began giving her Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery, which she took steadily for two years. During that time she
gained rapidly in strength; the lungs became normal, the cough leaving her
entirely. We are never without this medicine in the house, and have
recommended it to all our friends, and I am positively certain that if Dr.
Pierce's medicine is used in time, it will cure in other cases as well as
in this one.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I am 29 years old. During the winter of '84 I
contracted a severe cold, which settled on my lungs. Each succeeding winter
my cough grew worse, and in the winter of '85 I had chicken-pox, and taking
cold, drove them in causing me a severe spell of sickness. The following
summer I had congestion of the lungs and hemorrhage and a severe spell of
fever. My physician advised me to go West in search of health. My friends
thought I had consumption of the lungs, I coughed so much. In September,
1889, I left Carthage, Mo. (where I then lived), for Phoenix, Ariz. After I
had been there about four months I had a severe attack of "<i>La
Grippe</i>" and with this I coughed myself almost (I thought), to death;
and to add to my distress I had an almost intolerable attack of pleurisy. A
doctor was summoned and after an examination said I had Empyemia, and said
he could do me but very little good until he removed the pus. He and his
partner came and by the use of an aspirator drew off nine pints of pus;
after about a week he drew off two pints. After a few days I told my doctor
I could hear the pus gurgle as I had before he drew it off. Strange to say,
but nevertheless true, my heart was crowded over on the opposite side for
three months. I knew it was there for I could feel the pulsations there,
and I was so short of breath for a long time I could not stoop down to tie
my shoes.</p>

<p>The doctor told me it would be useless again to use the aspirator, but
that he would be obliged to make an incision in my side and treat it till I
got well. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524"></a>[pg
524]</span>On the 28th day of March. 1890, my doctor and his partner and
three other doctors undertook the operation, and, after removing about two
inches of one of my ribs, withdrew 16 pints of pus. This came near being
too much for me though I slowly recovered and in three months the doctors
thought I was able to come home. I arrived home in June and was very poorly
all summer, and did not sit up but <i>very little</i>, and had fever every
day. In the latter part of the summer of '90 I commenced to take "Golden
Medical Discovery" and although my side had been discharging for
TWENTY-THREE MONTHS it healed up sound and well. I am now able to do
considerable hard work. I would advise all who are afflicted as I was, to
give your medicine a trial. I am glad I have out-lived my friends'
expectations.</p>

spitting blood for the past six years. Menstruation was scant and caused
great prostration. Suffered from constipation; cutting pains about the
stomach and rumbling in the bowels; exceedingly nervous; indigestion. She
writes as follows: "I wish to inform you that I am well. I never can praise
you or your ways of treatment enough. I shall bring you all the patients
that I can. I feel so rich to get my health back. I can eat well and sleep
well, and work all day. I suppose you will think it took a long time to
pull me up, but I was very low, much worse than I ever told you of at the
time. I was not able even to feed myself any more. My husband had to
undress me. I could not wash my own face, or stand alone. I did not lie
down to sleep for eleven months; I always had to sit up, because I would
choke if I laid my head down. <i>I have not raised a drop of blood since
your treatment</i>, and I did it always for five years before. Our minister
said this spring that he had never thought I could live, and says that he
advises every one that is sick to go to you. He was so surprised to see how
strong and well I was. My relatives all think that you ought to write my
case up for the papers in Chicago. I can never repay you for what you have
done for me. A thousand thanks is but empty words. My husband was telling a
man just last week, "do not spend all your money in Chicago, as we did, and
then write to Buffalo, but go and write now, and your wife will soon be
well." My father was saying that he wished the doctors that gave me up
could see me now. I think they could not believe their own eyes. I am
astonished when I think back how I was six years ago; I could not walk
across the room alone for three years, and after taking your treatment for
eighteen months, I am <i>completely</i> well. I can hardly believe it
myself when I read over those letters that I received from you. I work hard
every day. There is never a day that you are not remembered. I hope that
you may live many years to do for others what you have done for me. I had
this taken so that you might have my picture as I am now; I wish you could
have seen me as I was then, and I wish to thank you for those little notes
of inquiry that you used to send to find out how I was getting along, which
showed that I was remembered not only while the money lasted, but that you

confined to bed for nearly six months. I had four doctors to see me, but it
just seemed to me that they could relieve me for only a short while. I had
a bad cough and all thought I was going into consumption. After being sick
for so long, my nerves were nearly exhausted and my stomach, liver and
bowels refused to act, in fact, my whole system was completely wrecked. I
could not rest nor sleep, unless influenced by some drug and at last,
mother concluded to try your medicines on me. She had taken them about a
year before and had been greatly benefited by their use, so she said I will
try the last resort&mdash;for I had been given up to die.</p>

<p>I began taking your "Golden Medical Discovery" and "Pleasant Pellets." I
improved rapidly&mdash;was soon able to be up in my room, and to my surprise, I
could eat a little of nearly everything I desired. Before I began the use

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;Some twenty-five years since I was feeling very
miserable all summer; I was very bilious; sometimes my bowels would not
move once in sixty or seventy hours, and then almost impossible. I would
take some bitters, which would help to move the matter, but as soon as the
bitters were gone, I had to buy more or I would be as bad as before, and
sometimes worse; but none of them appeared to do me any good except to move
the bowels, until thirty years since a druggist called my attention to Dr.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, and before I had taken half a bottle of
the "Golden Medical Discovery" I felt much better and by the time I had
taken all, I could eat three hearty meals per day and had not felt so well
for a long time. Soon after I was called to do a job some miles from home,
and one night the old lady there was speaking about her daughter, (Mrs.
Brooks) who had been under the doctor's care for five months and did not
get any better, and I learned by asking a few questions that she had no
appetite, and no ambition to do anything. Then I told her what the "Golden
Medical Discovery" had done for me. The next day the old lady drove down to
her daughter's, and got Mr. Brooks to send to Rutland&mdash;ten miles away&mdash;for
two bottles of the "Golden Medical Discovery," and the next day the doctor
came, and when about to take leave, Mr. Brooks told the doctor he did not
want him any more at present and would send for him if necessary. I saw the
old lady about ten days later and her daughter was improving, and Mr.
Brooks had great faith in the "Golden Medical <span class="pagenum"><a

very bad form and was then taken with a very bad cough, which kept growing
worse and worse, until finally it seemed as though she had consumption very
bad. The physicians prescribed Cod liver oil, but to no benefit. Mrs.
Miller, a neighbor of ours, recommended Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery to me with very strong faith, as she had been in the same
condition and was cured by its use. I procured two bottles and she grew
better. She hasn't felt any return of lung disease in over twelve months.
She was nothing but a skeleton when she took the first dose, and to-day she
weighs 135 pounds. I thought it my duty to write to you in regard to her
case, as so many other medicines had failed, and it has acted like a
charm.</p>

<p>WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I am happy to inform you that after consulting you by
letter and two months' trial of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, I am
enjoying a better state of health than I have for some time. I have had
weak lungs for several years&mdash;at times spit up blood. In January, 1893, I
took a severe cold, which settled on my lungs&mdash;had a very bad cough, it
seemed as if my lungs were swollen; could not expectorate much at a time,
very hard to get up; suffered much with pains in my chest; was reduced in
flesh and became very weak.</p>

<p>Physicians prescribed for me but I found no relief until I consulted
you. It seemed I was going into consumption very fast. I have as good
health now as could be expected. I am fifty-seven years of age and able to
work on my farm, and feel under many obligations for your kind advice. Also
my stomach was out of order, suffered with burning in my stomach and chest.
I have no burning nor pains in my stomach and chest now.</p>

my wife's family; some have already died with the disease. My wife has a
sister, Mrs. E.A. Cleary, that was taken with consumption. She used your
"Golden Medical Discovery," and, to the surprise of her many friends, she
got well. My wife has also had hemorrhages from the lungs, and her sister
insisted on her using the 'Golden Medical Discovery." I consented to her
using it, and it relieved her. She has had no symptoms of consumption for
the past six years. People having this disease can take no better
remedy.</p>

<h4>LUNG AND WOMB DISEASE,</h4> <b>Dropsy, Sick Headache, Dyspepsia and

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;In the winter of 1881, I became irregular in my
monthly courses. Of course at first I paid but little attention to it,
hoping it would amount to nothing and probably wear away. But I slowly but
surely grew worse, and at last resolved to apply to the doctors for help.
My water came often, and in small quantities, and with great pain, and with
red brick-dust deposit. I was attacked with severe womb trouble, bloody
piles and dropsy of the ovary. I was treated by five different doctors. I
was compelled to wear an inside support for a year, but it still seemed
impossible for me to get well and I began to feel exceedingly alarmed and
very uneasy, not knowing what course to pursue, or what the consequences
might be. I had heard of Dr. Pierce, and concluded to make one more trial,
so I sat down and wrote a letter to him, stating matters as near as I
could, and in due time I received a favorable reply; then I commenced with
his medicine. I commenced somewhere in February 1891 with the "Golden
Medical Discovery" and "Favorite Prescription," in alternate doses. A
strange occurrence followed. My limbs felt like what we call "asleep," and
I felt as if I were in a strange land and wondered what was going to take
place. I kept on till I took nine bottles. The first relief I felt was from
sick headache, which I had been troubled with for many years; I was also
cured of a very bad cough which I had been troubled with for many years,
and of dyspepsia of long standing. I was entirely cured of a very singular
and severe itching on my back, between my shoulders, which our doctor's
called winter itch and which they pronounced incurable. I had suffered with
this for twenty years; it would come in the winter and go away in the
summer. I was also cured of the worst form of bloody piles and of womb
disease. At present I feel like a new person.</p>

<p>When I first commenced with Dr. Pierce's medicines, I could not walk
half <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531"></a>[pg
531]</span>a mile without a pain. The other day I walked to Mercersburgh
post-office, a distance of twelve miles, and the next day walked back
again, and felt no bad results from the Journey. I am now 51 years old.</p>

<p>Mrs. Knavel further writes, that "To any person desiring to know more
concerning my case and its wonderful cure, and who will enclose to me a
return self-addressed and stamped envelope for reply, I will be pleased to
write further information."</p>

Esq.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to you for the
wonderful cure that your special remedies performed in my case. In the
Spring of 1891, I had a severe attack of La Grippe, which left me in bad
shape. I consulted as good a physician as there was in the county, and he
told me that I was suffering from enlargement of the heart and that I must
be very careful about taking: any violent exercise, and I must not allow
myself to get excited, as excitement of any kind might prove fatal. He gave
me remedies for my trouble which made me feel some better; but being a
farmer I was obliged to work hard and soon began to run down. I began to
have spells of a terribly deathly sinking feeling at my stomach and a
terrible pressure at the heart&mdash;in the region of the heart, and sometimes I
would fall prostrate and although I was conscious all the time I could not
speak aloud.</p>

<p>The last of October, 1891, while doing my chores in the morning, I had
one of those bad spells and upset my lantern, which resulted in my losing
my buildings by fire.</p>

<p>My wife was out of health at that time&mdash;she, too, was suffering from the
effects of La Grippe. Having lost everything eatable for ourselves and
stock, I was forced to work very hard to get through the winter. The next
February, 1892, we had another attack of La Grippe, which resulted in the
death of my beloved wife. The next May, this terrible affliction together
with hard work completely broke me down and although I was doctoring all
the time I kept steadily growing worse. I got so bad that I could not sleep
more than two or three hours any night and very often I would go all night
without closing my eyes at all.</p>

<p>The last of September, I had to give up work almost entirely. I got so
that I <i>could not walk one-fourth of a mile without being completely
exhausted</i>. One physician whom I consulted said I was suffering with
nervous prostration and gave me medicine for it, but I got no better. My
food distressed me terribly and after eating, it would sour and I would
have to vomit up the most that I had eaten. At last, I got so I had to live
on bread made of wheat middlings and for about three months I could not eat
anything else, although it seemed as though I should starve to death. I
thought I would give anything if I could eat a hearty meal of anything that
I wanted, but did not dare to because every kind of food distressed me so.
My bowels became badly constipated and for three months I did not have a
natural operation of the bowels; and I suffered very much with catarrh, and
there was such a pressure across my forehead that it seemed sometimes as
though it would burst. I became very despondent. I did not want to go
anywhere, neither did I want to see any one, everything looked dark and
gloomy to me. When well, I was naturally or a lively disposition and a
great hand to joke with my friends, but no one could say anything funny
enough to get a smile out of me then. I was always very fond of music too,
but I could not bear to hear a bit of music, neither vocal nor
instrumental. About the first of February, 1893, some of my friends
prevailed upon me to consult a physician who made a specialty of treating
chronic nervous troubles; he said I had no organic trouble of the heart and
that it was caused by my stomach being out of order; he said that I had a
bad kidney trouble and that my spine was affected, and that unless I got
help it would end in "Locomotor Ataxia." He said he could help me but it
would probably take a year to cure me. He let me have a month's treatment
and gave me advice in regard to diet, etc. I thought for awhile that it was
helping me but soon I began to go down hill again, and as a last resort I
began to take some of the cure-alls (patent) with which the country is
flooded; but I soon became disgusted with them and made up my mind there
was no help for me. I had to use about all the strength I had to walk; I
could not lift my left foot up to step over anything&mdash;had to draw it after
me; I could hardly sleep; neither could I transact any business, in fact I
did not take any interest in any of my affairs. It seemed to me as though I
did not have a friend on earth, and I longed for death to come to put me
out of my misery.</p>

<p>My son, with whom I was living, had been trying for a long time to get
me to send to you for treatment, but I had paid out so much money and
received no benefit from it, that I did not believe there was any help for
me.</p>

<p>At last I thought I would write you what I could of my symptoms, and get
your opinion of my case, but it took me about two days to write the letter.
My head felt so bad that I could not collect myself enough to describe my
feelings. You wrote me that my trouble was caused by indigestion,
dyspepsia, catarrh, and spinal affection, and that you could cure me, and
in fact, make a new man of me if I would send for your special treatment
and follow your advice. My son sent for the medicine for me. I took it and
followed your directions as near as I <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_533" id="Page_533"></a>[pg 533]</span>could; the first week I
could not see much of any change&mdash;the second week I could see that I was
improving some, the third week I could look back and see that I had gained
considerable. I could sleep better; the bloating in my bowels did not
trouble me so bad; my stomach did not distress me so much and I could eat
different kinds of food and my digestion seemed to be improving fast; and
by using your Special Catarrh Remedy my nose began to run (it had been
nearly six months that my nose was perfectly dry) and one day it felt as
though something gave way in my head&mdash;it seemed to be back, in behind my
eyes, and I blowed a large amount of filth out of my head that looked like
the yolk of an egg, and it was nearly as thick as jelly; after that my head
began to improve rapidly and I began to gain in flesh and strength, and the
best of all is, I have kept right on gaining until at the present time <i>I
feel as well as I ever did in my life</i>. Sleep well, can eat three hearty
meals every day and digest them too, and eat anything I want, and seven
days in a week.</p>

<p>To look back now I don't see why I did not apply to you when I was first
taken sick. For about ten years ago. I had treatment of you for catarrh,
liver and kidney trouble, and you helped me then; also, about eight years
ago my wife had two months' treatment from you which helped her of the
troubles from which she was suffering at that time. All the reasons that I
can give, is, that owing to financial troubles and having to pay out so
much for sickness, I could not seem to get the money (that I could spare)
to pay for the treatment.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I wish I could express my thanks to you for what you have
done for me, but I cannot do it. I am a poor hand to express myself, but I
consider my restoration to health almost a miracle, and I firmly believe
that I owe my life to you, for I do not believe that I should have lived
till the present time had it not been for your Special Treatment. Now, if
there is any part of this letter that you would wish to publish, you are at
liberty to do so: and if it would be the means of directing any suffering
fellow being to a place where they can get relief, I shall be very
thankful.</p>

instead of better.</p>

large and pleasant; the table the very best; the nurses kind and
considerate, and the doctors skillful and of wide experience. While there I

praise.</p>

<p>I cannot say too much in favor of the World's Dispensary Medical

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I was troubled for several years with bronchial
disease, having a severe cough a good share of the time. Some of my friends
thought I had consumption; I got so weak I could scarcely walk across the
floor, and raised a good deal. I commenced taking Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery and my cough soon got better, and I have not been
troubled with it since. That was four years ago; I took only three bottles.
I would recommend it to all having throat or lung trouble. I have also used
Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy with equally good results. I believe that no one
need suffer long with chronic catarrh who is within reach of this
remedy.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;Five years since my family physician pronounced my
case Pulmonary Consumption. Since that time I nave taken various
treatments, some of which have given relief. One treatment that was
administered for nasal catarrh, from which I continued to be affected,
caused erosion of the mucous membrane, and destruction of the bony septum
which separates the two nostrils. Took cold quite easily, suffered from
considerable nasal catarrh, with discharges passing posteriorly dropping
into the throat; occasional cough with some shortness of breath on
exertion. A deep inspiration caused a dizzy sensation in the head; eyesight
was impaired as well as the memory. After sitting for a time, and then
quickly rising I suffered from blindness as well as a dizzy feeling in the
head. I never felt that I was entirely cured of my lung trouble, having
many of the symptoms which are common to those in the incipient stage of
consumption. I also suffered from indigestion, torpidity of the liver, and
constipation of the bowels.</p>

<p>Upon consulting at your Institution, was advised at once to begin the
course of specially prepared medicines as indicated in my case. In all, I
have only taken two months' special treatment, and it has now been six
months since I have required any medicine; all symptoms of disease have
entirely disappeared, and I desire to thank you for the interest you have
taken in my case, and the treatment prescribed. I have no objection to your
publishing my testimony, if by so doing others may be induced to place
themselves under your care for treatment at your Institution, or have
medicines sent to their homes.</p>

till I had taken three bottles, that was all I needed. I got well and
strong again.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;Twenty years ago I was nearly dead with nasal catarrh.
I had it several years before I knew what it was, then I read Dr. Pierce's
description of catarrh. I felt as he described. No one else had ever been
able to tell me anything of the symptoms he described. I simply concluded
that if he could so minutely describe, he could also relieve, and I
immediately placed myself under his treatment&mdash;by correspondence. In a few
months I was entirely relieved and have not suffered from it since.</p>

<p>At the time I placed myself under his care I could not breathe with my
mouth closed. My friends thought I could live only a few months more. I
have had no return of catarrh and enjoy good health. I believe Dr. Pierce's

not without dreaming, and when I awoke my head felt worse then when I
retired. Had indigestion, chronic constipation and stomach trouble.</p>

<p>A little more than a year ago, while reading in one of your Memorandum

<p>It gives me great pleasure to testify to the merits of Dr. Sage's
Catarrh Remedy. I can say honestly and candidly that it is the grandest
medicine ever compounded for catarrh. I suffered terribly with that
dreadful disease and thought my case a hopeless one. I have expended on my
case about forty dollars for different remedies guaranteed to cure catarrh
in its worst form, but received no benefit therefrom. I also received
treatment from two physicians, but they did me no good. Having read a great
deal about Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy, I concluded to try it. The first
bottle gave the most pleasing results, and the second bottle completely
cured my case, which I considered hopeless. I most heartily recommend Dr.
Sage's Catarrh Remedy to all suffering from catarrh, with the assurance
that it will surely cure. It is a great boon to suffering humanity. Hoping
that this humble testimony may be the means of leading many sufferers to
try your most valuable medicine with the same happy results as I
experienced, and wishing you the best of success, I am,</p>

for three years. During that time my side discharged large quantities of
pus and I had a dreadful cough. I was so weak that I could not walk fifty
yards without being completely exhausted. I had taken every kind of
medicine that was recommended for similar maladies, such as cod liver oil,
sarsaparillas, iron tonic and syrup of hypophosphites, without any relief.
I was about discouraged when I commenced taking Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery. I took six bottles and it completely restored me to health. The
discharge stopped from my side, and the cough has ceased. I am now able to
follow my profession, which is a teacher of penmanship. I can walk ten
miles any day without the least worry. If any one doubts this statement
they can write me and I will verify the above statement.</p>

<p>Trusting that this may be the means of assisting some one else who is
suffering untold miseries, as I did before using the "G.M.D."</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I was nearly deaf on the right side of my head. I used
three or four bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and four
bottles of Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy with the Nasal Douche, in the first
trial. Cold weather coming on I had to stop, as I could not use the
Injector in freezing weather, but I was greatly benefited. Along towards
spring I found it was coming back, from taking cold, and, after several
trials of other remedies, I again began the use of your medicines, taking
two bottles of the "Golden Medical Discovery" and three bottles of Dr.
Sage's Catarrh Remedy, and I feel safe in believing I am cured as I feel no
signs of its return. My health is very good for a man of 74 years of age
and I am satisfied that Dr. Pierce's Medicines did it. I recommend them
whenever I have a chance.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I am extremely sorry not to have informed you sooner
of the magnificent result I obtained from your most valuable medicines.
When, sometime ago, I consulted you in regard to my affliction, bronchitis,
I was indeed fearing the worst. But I had so much confidence in your
medicines, which I had previously used for colds and liver complaint with
good results, that I strictly followed your kind advice and continued
taking it until I was assured of perfect health. I took five bottles of
your Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, using the "Pellets" combined as
directed, and <i>the effect was magical</i>. I am now healthy and hearty.
Heartily thanking you for your kind advice and assistance, I remain,
gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I contracted a cough during the winter of 1889 and
tried many different kinds of cough medicines, but none did me any good. I
at last became alarmed, and wrote to Dr. R.V. Pierce to know if he could
prepare a medicine that would cure me, and I was advised to try his "Golden
Medical Discovery," which I did, and am glad to say that only two bottles
cured me after letting the cough run on from the winter of 1889 until the
spring of 1893.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;For several years I was troubled with catarrh and
deafness of the right ear&mdash;the hearing becoming more and more defective
until I could scarcely hear at all. There was a constant ringing, roaring
noise in my ear, and finally the disease assumed a very painful form.</p>

<p>The ear became very sensitive to the touch, and the pain and
inflammation extended into the eustachian tube and down into the throat. I
could scarcely sleep at night, and during the day I suffered
constantly.</p>

<p>I finally decided to consult Dr. Pierce, and acting under his advice, I
began the use of "Golden Medical Discovery" and Sage's Catarrh Remedy by
means of Dr. Pierce's Nasal Douche.</p>

<p>I soon began to improve and after using three bottles each of the above
named remedies the pain and soreness left my ear, my hearing returned and I
considered myself completely cured, and indeed there has been no recurrence
of the trouble since.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;For some months I suffered from a shortness of breath
and dryness in the throat which usually came on at night, and these
symptoms gradually became aggravated until it was impossible for me to
procure enough sleep so that I could perform my daily duties about the
farm. Deriving no relief from such treatment as I was taking I came to your
Institution, was examined by your specialist, who pronounced my case
asthma, complicated with nasal catarrh. After using the special medicines
which he prepared for me for a few days I commenced to feel better, the
shortness of breath gradually disappearing; the paroxysms of asthma were
less frequent and not so severe.</p>

<p>After taking only two months' treatment I was completely restored to my
previous good health, and for five months it has not been necessary for me
to use any medicine, and I feel that I am perfectly well. I give you this
testimonial in order that others who are similarly afflicted may know of

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;In January of '90 took the "grippe," went to work
before I was well, was caught in a rain which gave me a very bad relapse,
resulting in lung fever and complete prostration; was on my bed two months,
and when I did get out, the strength to walk any more than just a few rods
did not come back. My family doctor and two prominent physicians of Sioux
City, did me no good. Late in the fall I got a bottle of Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery, which quieted my trembling nerves and gave me an
appetite to eat. I then concluded to try the Doctor, personally. Up to this
time I was in a pitiable condition. Sometimes I could not sleep until I
felt almost wild, then sleep so much I would be stupefied. I could not
digest any food and my whole system was wasting and failing fast. I doubt
if any one who saw me expected me to get well. I took the treatment sent me
by the World's Dispensary Medical Association for more than a year. The
medicine never gave me any distress as other medicines had done before. I
began to improve from the start, but the change from one extreme to the
other was like the growth of a child.</p>

<p>To any one suffering from nervous prostration I would say, "don't be
impatient." It takes a long time for weakened nerves to grow strong. I have
at last become strong and well, thanks to the Giver of all good and the
grand Institution at Buffalo. I nave since married a noble-hearted young
woman, and when I am playing with our sweet, healthy, baby girl, I give way
to the thought that at last the long, Bad chapter of my life is ended; at
such times her merry laugh sounds like a song of triumph of life over
death.</p>
