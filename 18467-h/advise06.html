<h2>DISEASES OF THE HEART.</h2>

<p>Diseases of the heart are classified as either <i>functional</i> or
<i>organic</i> We shall dwell only briefly upon purely <i>functional</i>
derangements of the heart; as <i>increased</i>, or excited action,
<i>defective</i>, or enfeebled action, and <i>irregular</i> action.</p>

<p>Increased action of the heart, indicated by palpitation, or increased
number of the beats, may be caused <i>mechanically</i>, as by distention of
the stomach, which, by preventing the descent of the diaphragm, excites the
action of this organ. Or it may be a <i>sympathetic</i> disturbance
produced through the nervous system; thus the emotions and passions may
suddenly arouse the heart to excessive action; or the presence of worms in
the intestines, improper food, and masturbation, may be the cause. The use
of tea, tobacco, and alcoholic drinks excites the heart. We have found that
the excessive use of tobacco is very frequently the cause of functional
derangement of this organ. Deficiency of the blood, as in an&aelig;mia, may
be the cause of palpitation of the heart.</p>

<p>Functional disturbance of the heart's action is manifested by
palpitation, irregularity, intermissions, a rolling or tumbling movement,
and a feeling as if the heart were in the throat. These symptoms often give
rise to great apprehension, anxiety, fear, and depression of mind.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The curative treatment of functional derangement of
the heart must have reference to the causes producing it. If it is in
consequence of indigestion, the appetite and digestion should be improved
by observing regularity in the time of taking the meals, and eating very
easily-digested food. The use of strong tea, coffee, tobacco, and spirits,
should be interdicted, and regular exercise, rest, and sleep should be
enjoined.</p>

<p>In all cases, the domestic management should include daily bathing,
exercise in the open air, regular habits, and the avoidance of all causes
which tend to excite the heart's irregularity.</p>

<p><i>The remedial treatment</i> of these functional affections ought to be
confided to some experienced physician, as the remedies are not within the
ordinary reach of all families, nor if they were, would they have
sufficient experience and knowledge to select and properly administer
them.</p>


<h3>ORGANIC DISEASE OF THE HEART.</h3>

<p>By organic disease we mean disease pertaining to the structure of the
heart itself, in contradistinction to <i>functional</i> disease, which has
reference merely to the <i>action</i> of the heart. The heart is subject to
various organic diseases, but we have only space to consider, in the
briefest manner, those which are the most common. It is essential that the
reader should have some knowledge of the anatomy and functions of the
various parts of the heart in order that its diseases and their effects may
be comprehended; therefore the anatomy and physiology of this <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548"></a>[pg 548]</span>organ,
given in Part I, Chapter VII, of this work, should be carefully
studied.</p>

<p>It is very evident that any disease which affects the structure and
function of any part of the heart must, necessarily, give rise to certain
modifications of the pulse, sounds, etc. It is through the observation and
study of these modifications and changes that we arrive at a correct
diagnosis as to the precise location and character of the disease.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise262"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 1. Pond's Sphygmograph." src="images/advise262.png" /></a><br />Fig.
1. Pond's Sphygmograph.</p>

<p>Until within comparatively recent years, physicians were very much in
the dark regarding diseases of the heart. Now, however, with a thorough
knowledge of the anatomy, physiology, and pathology of the heart and the
parts surrounding it, and with the aid of instruments which modern
ingenuity has given us, we are able to diagnosticate with precision the
slightest lesions of any part of this important organ, and, knowing their
nature, to map out an appropriate course of treatment. With the aid of the
stethoscope, invented by Laennec and improved upon by Camman, we are able
to distinguish the slightest deviation from the normal sounds, and, by
noting the character of the sound, the time when it occurs, the area over
which It is heard most distinctly, and the direction in which it is
transmitted, to locate the lesion which produces it. By the aid of the
sphygmograph, first invented by Herrisson, and afterward improved upon by
Ludwig, Vierordt, Marey, and lastly by Pond, of our own country, the
pulsations at the wrist are registered, and thus made perceptible to the
eye.</p>

<p>We herewith give a cut, Fig. 1, of Pond's instrument, and two tracings
made by it. The first is a healthy tracing, and the second indicates
enlargement, technically called hypertrophy, of the heart</p>

<p><b>Pericarditis</b>, or inflammation of the membranous sac which
surrounds the heart, may be either acute or chronic. The symptoms in acute
pericarditis are made up from co-existing affections, and are frequently
associated with articular rheumatism, Bright's disease of the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549"></a>[pg
549]</span>kidneys, or pleuritis The intensity of the pain varies in
different individuals. The action of the heart is increased, the pulse is
quick, and vomiting sometimes takes place. When this disease is developed
in the course of rheumatism, it is known as rheumatic pericarditis, and is
almost always associated with endocarditis. In some cases acute
pericarditis is very distressing, in others it is mild. The fatality is not
due so much to the disease itself, as to co-existing affections. When it
does not prove fatal, it sometimes becomes chronic.</p>

<p>In chronic pericarditis, pain is seldom present. The heart is generally
more or less enlarged, its sounds are feeble, the first being weaker than
the second.</p>

<p><b>Endocarditis</b>, or inflammation of the membrane lining the cavities
of the heart, is one of the most frequent forms of heart disease. It is
almost invariably associated with acute rheumatism, or some of the eruptive
fevers, as small-pox, scarlet fever, etc., and is due to the irritation of
the unhealthy blood passing through the heart. The disease is generally
attended with little or no pain, and, consequently, if the attending
physician be not on the alert, it will escape his observation. When
associated with acute rheumatism, the disease is only in rare instances
directly fatal, but in the great majority of cases it leaves permanent
organic changes, which sooner or later develop into valvular affections,
and these may eventually destroy life. When the disease occurs, however, as
the result of py&aelig;mia (blood-poisoning produced by the absorption of
decomposing pus or "matter") or of diphtheria, or when it is associated
with any other septic conditions, it constitutes a very grave element.
Collections of matter formed on the membrane lining the heart and covering
its valves, are liable to be detached and carried by the circulation to the
brain, spleen, or liver, where they plug up some artery, and thus cause
death of the parts which it supplies with blood.</p>

<p>Chronic endocarditis generally occurs in rheumatic subjects,
unassociated with any acute disease, It may exist without any marked
symptoms, except, perhaps, a sense of oppression and uneasiness in the
chest, with palpitation. It produces a thickening and hardening of the
membrane lining the heart, and generally causes a retraction, adhesion, and
degeneration of some of the valves of the heart, thus bringing on valvular
disease.</p>

<p><b>Valvular Lesions</b> are, as we have seen, very frequently the result
of endocarditis. They are of two kinds. First, those which prevent the
valves from flapping back close to the walls of the ventricles, or
arteries, thus diminishing, to a greater or lesser extent, the size of the
valvular orifices, and offering an obstruction to the free flow of blood
through them; and which consist of a thickening and retraction, or adhesion
of the valves, chalky deposits, morbid growths, etc. Secondly, those which
prevent complete closure of the valves, and thus permit a return of the
blood into the cavity from which it has just <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_550" id="Page_550"></a>[pg 550]</span>been expelled. These
latter consist of retractions, perforations, and partial detachments of the
valves, chalky deposits around the base of the valves and in them, and
rupture of the chord&aelig; tendine&aelig;.</p>

<p>These two forms of lesions are usually co-existent, one generally being
more extensive than the other. Thus, the regurgitation may be slight, and
the obstruction great, or <i>vice versa</i>. The symptoms and disturbance
of the circulation are altogether dependent upon the location and form of
the lesion, or lesions. Each valvular lesion has its characteristic sound,
or murmur, which is heard at a particular period in the cycle of the
heart's action, and it is, as before stated, from these sounds, from
tracings of the pulse, and from the many other indications, that we arrive
at a diagnosis. Thus, in obstruction of the orifice at the junction of the
aorta with the left ventricle, one of the most frequent of valvular
lesions, a murmur, generally harsh in character, is heard with the first
sound of the heart, with greatest intensity directly over the normal
position or the aortic semilunar valves. This is conveyed along the large
arteries, and may be heard, less distinctly, over the carotids. In the
sphygmographic tracing, the line of ascent is less abrupt than in the
normal tracing (Fig. 2), and not nearly so high, and it is rounded at the
top. In aortic regurgitation, the line of ascent is similar to that of the
healthy tracing, but the line of descent is very sudden. The left side of
the heart is almost invariably the primary seat of these affections, but in
the latter stages of their course, the right side also is liable to become
involved, and, as a consequence, there then exists great disturbance of the
venous circulation, with a damming back of the blood in the veins, and
passive congestion of the liver, kidneys and brain, followed by dropsy,
albumen in the urine, etc.</p>

The above is a representation of a tracing of a healthy pulse as made with
the Sphygmograph.</p>

<p><b>Hypertrophy of the Heart</b> consists of a thickening of the muscular
walls of this organ. It may be confined to one portion of the heart, or it
may affect the entire organ. The affection has been divided into the
following three forms: <i>Simple hypertrophy</i>, in which there is an
increase in the thickness of the walls of the heart, without any
augmentation in the capacity of the cavities, and which is usually the
result of chronic Bright's disease, or great intemperance; <i>eccentric
hypertrophy</i>, in which there is an increase in the thickness of the
walls of the heart, together <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551"
id="Page_551"></a>[pg 551]</span>with increase in the capacity of the
cavities, and which is generally the result of some valvular lesion; and
<i>concentric hypertrophy</i>, in which there is an increase in the
thickness of the walls of the heart, with a decrease in the capacity of the
cavities. Valvular lesions, obstructions in the large arteries, or, in
fact, any thing which calls upon the heart to constantly perform an undue
amount of labor must, necessarily, produce hypertrophy of its muscular
walls, just as the undue amount of labor which the blacksmith's arm is
called upon to perform produces hypertrophy of its muscles. With this
condition, the pulse is hard and incompressible, and the line of ascent in
the sphygmographic tracing (Fig. 3) is higher than in health.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise264"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 3." src="images/advise264.png" /></a><br />Fig. 3.</p>

<p><b>Dilatation of the Heart</b> is a condition which is closely allied to
hypertrophy of the heart, and which consists of an increase in the capacity
of the cavities of the heart, with diminished contractile power. In simple
dilatation, there is an increase in the capacities of the cavities, without
any marked change in the walls of the organ. It is usually the result of
some disease which has produced great muscular prostration, and which has
interfered materially with nutrition. More frequently, however, dilatation
is the result of valvular lesions, and is associated with hypertrophy,
there being an increase in the thickness of the walls with a diminution of
the contractile power. The hypertrophy from valvular lesions goes on
increasing until it reaches a certain stage, when dilatation commences, the
two conditions then being associated.</p>

<p><b>Atrophy</b> of the heart is the opposite to hypertrophy, and
signifies a wasting away of the muscular substance, and a diminution in the
thickness of the walls of the heart. Its power is diminished in proportion
to the degree of atrophy.</p>

<p><b>Fatty Degeneration</b> of the heart consists in the deposition of
particles of fat within the <i>sarcolemma</i> (the sheath which invests the
fibrils), which are substituted for the proper muscular tissue. If the
fatty degeneration exists to any extent the muscular walls present a
yellowish color, and the heart is soft and flabby. This may be confined to
one ventricle, or it may affect the inner layer of fibres, the outer layer
remaining unchanged. Degeneration of the left ventricle occasions
feebleness of the pulse. Difficulty in breathing is one symptom of this
disease, especially when the right ventricle is affected. There is pallor,
feeble circulation, cold extremities, and frequently dropsy. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552"></a>[pg 552]</span>Fatty
degeneration is more liable to occur in corpulent persons, and between the
ages of forty and fifty years.</p>

<p><b>Angina Pectoris</b>, also termed <i>neuralgia of the heart</i>, might
be included among the diseases of the nervous system, but as it is usually
associated with a derangement in the action of the heart, it may be
properly considered in this connection. The pain varies in intensity,
sometimes being very acute, at others assuming a milder form. The action of
the heart is more or less disturbed. The beats are irregular, at times
being strong, while again they are feeble. A feeling of numbness is
experienced in those parts to which the pain penetrates. These paroxysms
<i>usually</i> continue but a few minutes, although they sometimes last
several hours. Persons suffering from angina pectoris are liable to sudden
death. It is connected with ossification, or other organic changes of the
heart. Usually these paroxysms, if the life of the patient continues,
become more and more frequent. The danger is not to be measured by the
intensity of the pain, but by the co-existing organic disease. Although it
is not absolutely certain that organic disease is present in all cases of
angina pectoris, yet the exceptions are so rare that when the signs of
organic disease cannot be detected, it may be inferred that angina is not
the real affection, or that the existing lesions escape observation. Those
who suffer from this disease are, in the great majority of cases, of the
male sex, and rarely under the age of forty.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In the foregoing consideration of organic diseases of
the heart, we have omitted to speak of their remedial management, for the
obvious reason that unprofessional readers are unable to correctly
distinguish between the various diseases of this vital organ; and it would,
therefore, be useless for us to attempt to instruct them as to the
medicinal treatment of the different cardiac affections.</p>

<p>In the vast majority of instances, diseases of the heart are not
necessarily speedily fatal. Persons have been known to live twenty years or
more with very extensive organic disease of this organ.</p>

<p>It is <i>very important</i>, however, that a correct diagnosis be made
in the early stages of these diseases, in order that an appropriate course
of hygiene and treatment may be adopted, which will check their progress.
While we cannot cure extensive organic diseases of the heart, we <i>can</i>
check their progress, and prolong life, and render the condition of the
subject comparatively comfortable. Since we are able to diagnosticate with
the utmost precision the various affections of the heart, and since the
discovery of certain specific medicines which exert most beneficial
effects, we are enabled to treat this class of maladies with the most
gratifying results. Thus we have seen a case in a very advanced stage of
the disease, with the breathing so difficult that the subject had been
compelled to remain almost constantly in the sitting posture, in the
greatest agony, for so long a time that immense bed sores had formed on the
seat; in which the dropsy had become so extensive that <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553"></a>[pg 553]</span>the
skin of the legs had burst open; and yet this patient, through the
influence of a specific course of treatment, was speedily relieved, and
enabled to live in a comparatively comfortable condition for many
months.</p>

<p>One afflicted with heart disease should abstain from the use of all
kinds of stimulants, tobacco, and whatever tends to lower vitality. His
life should be an even one, free from all excitement of any kind
whatsoever. He should avoid severe physical exertion, and everything which
causes the heart to beat with undue frequency.</p>

<p>There are certain symptoms, the result of <i>chlorosis</i> (the green
sickness), a deficiency of blood, dyspepsia, uterine disease, and certain
nervous affections, which may simulate those of real organic disease, but
the physician of education and experience, with a trained ear, is able to
detect the difference speedily.</p>


<h3>SORE MOUTH. (STOMATITIS.)</h3>


<p>Stomatitis, or inflammation of the mucous membrane of the mouth, may
include the entire surface of the gums, tongue, and cheeks, or appear only
in spots. Vesicles are formed, having swollen edges and a white or yellow
center, which finally ulcerate. When mild, the affection is confined to
these parts.</p>

<p>If the inflammation is acute, the mouth is dry and parched, or as is
more frequently the case, the flow of saliva is abundant and acrid, and,
when swallowed, irritates the stomach and bowels, producing fever,
diarrhea, griping pains, and flatulency. The tongue is either coated white
or red, and is glossy, and the sense of taste is considerably impaired.
Digestion and nutrition are then disturbed, and the patient becomes rapidly
emaciated.</p>

<p><b>Thrush, or Canker</b>, is that form of stomatitis in which white
ulcers locate on the inner side of the upper lip, the tongue, or roof of
the mouth; the irritation which they cause not only interferes with eating,
but produces fever, together with the symptoms previously mentioned.</p>

<p><b>Apth&aelig;</b>, or follicular inflammation, is distinguished by very
painful little ulcers, single or in clusters, scattered over the surface of
the tongue and lining of the mouth. Sometimes it is complicated with little
lumps in the tongue. These form ulcers and denote scrofulous inflammation.
Fissures and cracks in the tongue indicate derangement of the stomach.</p>

<p><b>The Causes</b> of stomatitis, in nursing infants, are unhealthy milk,
or effete matter, which, for lack of proper care and cleanliness,
accumulates upon the nipple. In older children, improper diet, irritants,
debility of the digestive functions, or hereditary syphilitic taint,
disorder the blood and induce local inflammation.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. Locally, use a wash of golden seal or gold thread
sweetened with maple-sugar, and rendered slightly alkaline with borax or
saleratus. Also use a very weak, alkaline tea, or one of slippery-elm <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554"></a>[pg 554]</span>flour,
to obviate the acridity of the secretions. If the sores do not heal,
constitutional treatment may be required, as the use of the Golden Medical
Discovery. The family physician should be consulted if the sore mouth
resists all these remedial measures.</p>


<h3>NURSING SORE MOUTH. (STOMATITIS MATERNA.)</h3>


<p>During the period of nursing, and sometimes in the latter months of
pregnancy, women are liable to a peculiar variety of sore mouth. The
soreness is sometimes so great that, although the appetite may be ravenous,
the patient cannot eat. When this condition extends to the stomach and
bowels, symptoms of a very grave character appear, and the disease, by
interfering with the process of nutrition, causes emaciation and debility,
and in extreme cases, death. It is a strange affection, nearly always
disappearing upon weaning the child, though this course is not absolutely
necessary. It appears to depend upon a hepatic, or gastric derangement, in
connection with a vitiated condition of the blood, but how this is brought
about is unknown.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The disease sometimes comes on suddenly, at others more
slowly. The fact that the woman is either pregnant or nursing, is of
importance in forming a diagnosis. At first there is a severe, scalding
sensation of the tongue, mouth, and fauces, with pain, which is sometimes
intense. The color of the tongue is often pink, or a light red, while the
mouth is generally of a deeper hue. This stinging, biting sensation is
accompanied by a profuse, watery discharge from the mouth, which seems
extremely hot and acrid, causing excoriation whenever it comes in contract
with the face or chin. The appetite is good, sometimes ravenous, but food
or drinks, except of the blandest character, occasion such intense pain
that the patient avoids their use. Ulceration occurs after a little time.
The bowels are generally constipated, but when the disease extends to the
stomach or intestines, diarrhea occurs. There is generally an&aelig;mia,
debility, and impairment of the vital powers.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The indications for treatment in this affection are to
overcome the vitiated condition of the blood, and to sustain the vital
powers. The remedies for this purpose are alteratives, antiseptics, and
tonics. Give the Golden Medical Discovery, the value of which may be
greatly enhanced by adding one-half ounce of the fluid extract of baptisia
to each bottle, in doses of a teaspoonful four times a day. Chlorate of
potash, half an ounce in a pint of water, used as a wash and gargle, is of
great value. A teaspoonful of the same may be swallowed several times a
day. This will not interfere with other medicines. As a tonic, the tincture
of the muriate of iron, in five to ten-drop doses, diluted with water, may
be taken three or four times daily. Quinine, in one or two-gram doses,
should be given with the iron if the debility be extreme. When there is
great acidity of the stomach, which may be known by heart burn, saleratus
may be taken in water, to neutralize it, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_555" id="Page_555"></a>[pg 555]</span>but should not be drunk
within an hour of the time for taking other medicines. If constipation
exists, use the Pleasant Pellets. This course of treatment, thoroughly
carried out, will seldom fail to effect a perfect cure, without weaning the
child, yet this latter course may sometimes become advisable to promote the
recovery of the patient. Should the treatment advised not produce the
desired result, a skillful physician's services should be secured, as he
may, in individual cases, distinguish other important indications which may
enable him to modify the treatment to advantage.</p>


<h3>DIARRHEA, CHOLERA INFANTUM, OR SUMMER COMPLAINT, AND DYSENTERY.</h3>


<p>These diseases are usually considered separately by medical writers but,
as they are closely related, a simple diarrhea not unfrequently running
into a <i>cholera infantum</i> or a dysentery, we shall consider them
together.</p>

<p><b>Diarrhea</b> is an affection characterized by unnaturally frequent
evacuations from the bowels of a liquid of morbidly soft consistency. It
may be simple or inflammatory, and acute or chronic.</p>

<p>A diarrhea is said to be bilious when the discharges are composed
principally of serum, highly colored with yellow or green bile; catarrhal,
when they are of a semi-transparent, mucous character; serous, when the
dejections are thin and watery, sometimes mixed with blood, bile, or
ingesta.</p>

<p>The symptoms of the affection are usually at first those of indigestion,
a fullness of the stomach, flatulency, and colicky pains. The pains, which
precede each evacuation, are intermittent in character. There may be an
unpleasant sinking sensation in the abdomen, and, with the discharge,
exhaustion, a feeble pulse, and a cool skin. In the inflammatory variety,
there is more or less fever.</p>

<p><b>Cholera Infantum</b>, or summer complaint, is a disease peculiar to
the warm season, and more prevalent in cities, and among those children who
do not nurse at the breast. It is characterized by great irritability of
the stomach, and persistent vomiting and purging, the discharges from the
bowels being copious and watery, and sometimes containing specks of curd,
yellowish-green matter, and mucus. The limbs of the little sufferer are
usually drawn up, indicating pain in the bowels, and there is great
prostration with cold extremities. The invasion may be so sudden, and the
disease so violent as to destroy life in a few hours.</p>

<p><b>Dysentery</b>, also known as <i>bloody-flux,</i> consists of an
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the large intestine, with ulceration
of the affected surfaces. The disease is accompanied with much nervous
prostration, and is distinguished by severe pains in the abdomen of a
griping nature, followed by frequent scanty and bloody stools, and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556"></a>[pg 556]</span>much
straining. Occasionally the attack is ushered in with a chill and aching
pains in various parts of the body, with copious fecal dejections. In other
cases the attack is preceded by loss of appetite, a sense of uneasiness
with dull pains in the abdomen, and weariness. The disease, like diarrhea,
may be either acute or chronic.</p>

<p><b>The Causes</b> of these affections of the bowels are many and varied.
They may be brought on by exposure to cold and wet, or by improper and
indigestible articles of food, such as unripe fruits, salads, pastries,
and, in fact, anything which interferes with the normal operations of the
digestive apparatus. One of the most fertile sources of diarrhea in
infants, and of <i>cholera infantum</i>, is the administration of
unsuitable food, the ill effects of which are greatly increased by exposure
to heat or cold. Uncleanliness, and the inhalation of impure air, are
prolific causes Of these diseases. Epidemics have been supposed to be due
to some peculiarity in the condition of the atmosphere, or to some
impalpable germ of a vegetable or animal nature.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. In the treatment of these diseases, one should first
endeavor to ascertain the cause of the trouble, and then, if possible,
effect its removal. Attention should be given to the hygienic surroundings
of the individual afflicted; if he reside in a miasmatic district, or in a
location in which the atmosphere is contaminated by the decomposition of
animal or vegetable matter, or filled with noxious gases, his abode should
be changed. A pure, dry air is most beneficial in these cases.</p>

<p>Only the least irritating and most easily digestible articles of food
should be taken. Healthy cow's milk is slightly alkaline, but that of cows
fed on slops is usually acid, and unfit for infants. It is, therefore, well
to test all milk with blue litmus paper before feeding it to young
children. If found to be strongly acid, that is if it turns the paper red,
it should be rejected, but if only slightly so, sufficient lime water may
be added to render it slightly alkaline. For adults and older children, the
diet should consist of such starchy foods as arrow-root, sago, corn starch,
and rice, and of ripe grapes, freed from the skins and seeds, peaches, and
boiled milk, or milk and lime water. In some cases the animal broths are
beneficial, especially mutton broth. To quench the thirst, crust coffee,
rice coffee, and lemonade, in small quantities, may be taken.</p>

<p>Rest is important in these diseases. In severe cases, the patient should
be kept in bed.</p>

<p>At the onset of an attack of diarrhea or dysentery, if there be reason
to believe that the intestinal tract contains irritating matter, a dose of
castor oil, with a few drops of anise oil added to render it palatable,
should be administered. After all irritating ingesta have been removed, Dr.
Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-weed should be given in doses
proportionate to the age of the patient, and the severity of the case.
Being composed of the extract of smart-weed, or water pepper, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557"></a>[pg 557]</span>Jamaica
ginger, camphor, and genuine French grape brandy, it exerts a most
wonderful effect not only in those diseases but in cholera morbus and
intestinal colic. It allays the irritation and inflammation of the affected
mucous surfaces, and soothes the nervous system. In the great majority of
cases, the above course of treatment will be found sufficient, but in the
more severe forms of these diseases additional remedies may be
required.</p>

<p>In dysentery, accompanied with severe pain and straining, injections of
starch water and laudanum, from two to four ounces of the former to from
twenty to fifty drops of the latter should be used.</p>

<p>Hot fomentations applied to the abdomen are beneficial. If the
discharges contain much blood, a flannel cloth moistened with the spirits
of turpentine should be laid over the lower part of the abdomen, and kept
there until slight irritation is produced.</p>

<p>Lime water, bicarbonate of soda, bicarbonate of potash (saleratus),
chalk, and the subnitrate of bismuth are valuable agents to correct the
secretions, and allay irritation of the diseased mucous surface. The
above-named preparations of soda, potash, and bismuth may be taken in doses
of from five to twenty grains every few hours.</p>

<p>Blackberry root and cranesbill (<i>Geranium Maculatum</i>), in the form
of fluid extract or infusion, are beneficial in acute cases in which the
discharges are profuse and watery, and in the chronic forms of these
affections.</p>

<p>In <i>cholera infantum</i> subnitrate of bismuth should be given in
doses of from five to ten grains at intervals of from two to four hours. If
the discharges are very profuse, the fluid extract of cranesbill may be
administered in from two to ten-drop doses alternately with the bismuth.
The camphorated tincture of opium (paregoric) is required in doses of from
two to twenty drops, depending upon the age of the child and the severity
of the case, if there is much pain, but great caution should be exercised
in administering the preparations of opium to children. A single drop of
laudanum given to a young infant has caused convulsions, coma, and death in
more than one instance. To check the vomiting of <i>cholera infantum</i>,
mild irritation over the stomach is sometimes effectual. For this purpose a
weak mustard plaster, or a cloth moistened with turpentine, may be laid
over the stomach for a few minutes at a time. If the child is old enough to
suck pellets of ice, these are beneficial, or a piece can be wrapped in a
cloth and sucked.</p>


<h3>COLIC.</h3>


<p><i>Colic</i> is a term applied to griping pains in the abdomen, which
are sometimes accompanied with nausea and vomiting. The derangement is
recognized in several forms, some of which we shall briefly describe.</p>

<p><b>Bilious Colic</b>. This may be the result of a morbid condition of
the liver.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. It is characterized by severe pain occurring in
paroxysms, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558"></a>[pg
558]</span>which may be relieved by pressure upon the bowels. The pulse is
quick, the tongue coated, and the skin harsh and dry; there is headache,
impaired appetite, acrid taste in the mouth, thirst, nausea, attended with
vomiting and general chilliness, followed by febrile symptoms.</p>

<p><b>Cause</b>. It may be induced by exposure to cold, in consequence of
which the circulation is impeded, the pores of the skin obstructed, and all
of the vitiated matters having to be expelled through the liver, stomach,
and intestines. It may also be due to malaria in the atmosphere. It most
commonly occurs during the autumn, after a season of hot weather.</p>

<p><b>Flatulent Colic</b>. Flatulent or "wind" colic is one of the results
of indigestion.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. A sense of fullness in the pit of the stomach, attended
with pain, which is transferred from one part of the bowels to another.
There is fever, a quick pulse, nausea, and the presence of gas; by the
latter feature it may be detected from the other forms.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Cold or atmospheric changes, the eating of unripe fruits,
uncooked vegetables and those articles of diet which ferment easily, are
the principle causes.</p>

<p><b>Painter's Colic</b>. This form is also known by various names, such
as <i>colica pictonum, saturnine</i>, or <i>lead colic</i>. Those persons
who are engaged in the manufacture of lead, and painters, are the most
frequent victims of this affection.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. Impaired appetite, fetid breath, thickly coated tongue,
obstinate constipation, a dry skin, scanty urine, languor, severe pain in
the umbilical region, and general derangement of the functions of the
system.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. From the term applied to this form, the cause may be
inferred. It is induced by the absorption of lead through the lungs,
stomach, and skin.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The indication to be fulfilled in <i>bilious</i> colic
is to relieve the intestinal spasm. This may be done by drinking freely of
a decoction of yam-root, or <i>dioscorea villosa</i>, which is an effectual
remedy in this affection. If this be not at hand, the spasm may be relieved
by administering freely of Dr. Pierce's Extract of Smart-Weed. If the
stomach be irritable, a tablespoonful of laudanum and one of tincture of
lobelia, in four ounces of starch water, administered as an injection, is
effectual. If simple means do not promptly arrest the attack, no time
should be lost in summoning the family physician.</p>

<p>In <i>flatulent</i> colic, the treatment should depend upon the cause.
If it be occasioned by cold, a teaspoonful or two of the Extract of
Smart-weed, in warm water or catnip tea, repeated a few times, will be
sufficient. If it result from overloading the stomach, a dose of the
Pleasant Pellets will answer the purpose. If the pain in the abdomen is
severe, apply hot fomentations. Assist the action of physic, by giving an
injection <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559"></a>[pg
559]</span>of senna and catnip tea, or if the stomach is very sour, take
internally some mild alkali, such as common saleratus.</p>

<p>In <i>painters'</i> colic, the following cathartic mixture is an
effectual remedy: sulphate of magnesia (epsom salts), twelve ounces;
nitrate of potassa (saltpeter), half an ounce; sulphuric acid, one drachm;
boiling water, one quart. Of this remedy give a teaspoonful every thirty
minutes or every hour, until the bowels move. An injection of some
diaphoretic tea, or of alum water, is a good remedy. Castor oil and
molasses, containing a teaspoonful of spirits of turpentine, will add to
the efficiency of an injection. If the colic be not promptly relieved, a
physician should be employed. To eliminate the lead from the system, and
thus prevent a return of the colic, or other injurious effects, two drachms
of iodide of potassium should be added to a bottle of the Golden Medical
Discovery, and a teaspoonful of this taken four times a day.</p>


<h3>JAUNDICE. (ICTERUS.)</h3>


<p>This affection is generally regarded as a symptom of disordered liver,
since it frequently occurs during the progress of diseases of that organ.
When the disease imparts a greenish tinge to the skin, it is termed
<i>green jaundice,</i> and, when it imparts a blackish color, it is known
as <i>black jaundice.</i> Jaundice is undoubtedly due to the presence of
biliary elements in the blood.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. In consequence of the varied conditions from which it
arises, Professor Da Costa has aptly remarked: "With the <i>recognition</i>
of jaundice, the difficulty in diagnosis may be said to begin." He
considers the causes of jaundice to be (1) diseases of the liver; (2)
disease or the bile ducts; (3) diseases remote from the liver, or general
disease leading to a disorder of that viscus; (4) certain causes acting
upon the blood.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. It is characterized by a yellowish color of the skin
and of the white of the eyes. The skin is usually dry and harsh; if it be
moist, the linen will be tinged yellow from the perspiration. The tongue is
coated yellow, the mouth is dry, and the appetite impaired; there is
headache, nausea, and sometimes vomiting; there is pain in the abdomen
after eating, and in the region of the liver, and it is also felt in the
right shoulder, and between the shoulder-blades. In severe cases, there is
fever, accompanied with chills, despondency and loss of flesh. The stools
are generally of a light clay color, and very offensive; the urine is thick
and yellow. When the disease terminates fatally, there is delirium followed
by stupor.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The first step should be to eliminate from the system,
as speedily as possible, all noxious materials. For this purpose, the
spirit-vapor bath should be used. If the urine is scanty or voided with
difficulty, take acetate of potash or queen of the meadow. These may <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560"></a>[pg 560]</span>be
taken in connection with the Golden Medical Discovery and Purgative
Pellets, the efficacy of which has already been described in the treatment
of chronic inflammation of the liver. They are indeed valuable agents in
this disease, since they increase the action of all the excretory glands,
and rapidly remove those matters, which, if retained, would poison the
system.</p>

<p>In some cases, acids are of great value; good hard cider or hydrochloric
acid and the acid bath are frequently valuable agents.</p>

<p>In other cases the employment, both internally and externally, of
alkalies in addition to the Golden Medical Discovery answers the purpose
much better.</p>

<p>Again, there are persons who, in addition to alteratives and baths,
require tonics. In the treatment or this affection, whatever may be the
nature of the case, the use of <i>alteratives</i> must not be forgotten,
for <i>without</i> them, the auxiliary treatment with acids, alkalies, and
tonics, will not produce the desired effect.</p>

<p>The employment of drastic remedies is sometimes resorted to; but,
although they may give temporary relief, the patient soon relapses into his
former condition, while if the treatment above given be adopted, the
recovery will be permanent.</p>


<h3>GALL-STONES. (BILIARY CALCULI.)</h3>


<p>These are concretions found in the gall-bladder or bile duct, and vary
from the size of a pea to that of a hen's egg. There may be no indication
of their existence in the gall-bladder until they begin to pass through the
duct.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. The formation of gall-stones is undoubtedly due to an
unhealthy condition of the bile. Corpulent persons, and those indulging in
over-stimulating diet, or in the habitual use of fermented drinks, are most
liable to be troubled by them.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The patient is suddenly seized with excruciating pain
in the right side. After a time it subsides, but is again renewed with as
great severity as before. There is nausea, with vomiting, which is often
excessive and severe. The pulse is sometimes slower than is natural, the
extremities are cold, there is great exhaustion, together with perspiration
and spasmodic contraction of the abdominal muscles. As soon as one stone
has passed through the duct into the intestine, immediate relief is
experienced until another commences to pass, and the larger the concretion,
the greater is the pain. If the stools be washed, the gall-stones may be
seen floating on top of the water.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. This consists chiefly in relieving the patient of pain
and vomiting during the passage of the gall-stones. Hot fomentations made
with stramonium leaves and lobelia, and applied over the painful parts, are
beneficial. Small doses of lobelia may be taken, but not in sufficient
quantities to produce vomiting. Doses of opium should also <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561"></a>[pg 561]</span>be
taken; this anodyne must, however, be used with care. Gelseminum is often
useful. Chloroform, ether, or the spirit vapor-bath generally allays the
pain. Carbonate of soda, dissolved in water, often relieves the
vomiting.</p>

<p>These distressing symptoms are apt to recur until the removal of all the
gall-stones is effected. To aid in removing them, take the Golden Medical
Discovery rather freely for a day or two, and continue its use with
lobelia, in doses sufficiently large to produce nausea, but not vomiting.
From four to eight ounces of sweet oil may be given, and, if the bowels do
not respond within three hours, repeat the dose, and the gall-stones will
generally be evacuated. To prevent the formation of these concretions take
the Golden Medical Discovery, together with alkaline drinks made with
carbonate of soda. Tone and energy will thereby be imparted to the liver,
the free flow of bile will be insured and the subsequent formation of
gall-stones prevented.</p>


<h3>INTESTINAL WORMS.</h3>


<p>We have not the space to discuss the numerous theories which have been
offered to account for the presence of these parasites in the human body.
We shall enumerate the principal species, describe the symptoms indicating
their presence, and indicate the proper remedies.</p>

<p>There are five species of intestinal worms, sufficiently common to merit
a description.</p>

<p>(1.) The round worm, termed by naturalists, <i>ascaris lumbricoides</i>,
varies from six inches to a foot in length, and resembles the common
earth-worm. It infests the small intestines, and seldom migrates into the
stomach or large bowel. Instances are recorded, however, in which it has
crept upward in the esophagus, larynx, nostrils, and eustachian tube; but
their presence in these parts is of comparatively rare occurrence, and is
generally caused by some local irritation which compels their migration.
The fact that they have been found in the peritoneal sac, gave rise to the
opinion that they perforate the intestine; but careful observations have
proved that they can only escape through openings made by ulcers.</p>

<p>This species has been found in adults, but is more common in children
from three to twelve years of age. The number of this species existing in a
human body is variable. Sometimes only two or three are found. At other
times a hundred, and even twice that number, are voided in a few days.</p>

<p>(2.) The <i>ascaris vermicularis</i>, thread, pin, or seat-worm, is
round, very slender, and about half an inch in length. The habitation of
this species is the rectum, and they are often found matted together in the
excrement. They are very active, even after ejection, and have been known
to cause great local irritation by entering the vagina and urethra. Their
presence is an occasional cause of masturbation. It <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562"></a>[pg 562]</span>is
impossible to estimate the number of these parasites that may exist in the
human rectum. Great numbers, sometimes, are voided at a single
evacuation.</p>

<p>(3.) The <i>tricocephalus dispar</i> is a third variety of the round
worm, and is said to infest the bodies of almost every species of mammalia.
As its name indicates, the upper portion of its body is slender, hair-like,
and terminates at the lower extremity in a thick, spiral portion. It is
from one to two inches in length, and is found attached by its head to the
mucous membrane of the c&aelig;cum, and, in rare instances, in the colon
and small intestine. They are rarely numerous.</p>

<p><i>T&aelig;ceni&aelig;</i> or <i>tape-worms,</i> are hermaphrodites, of
a flat, ribbon-like form, and are composed of numerous segments, each of
which is provided with a complete set of generative organs, and contains
ova for the production of thousands of individuals. Some authors have
supposed that each segment, or joint, is a distinct individual, but the
existence of one head for the whole precludes this theory. There are two
species of <i>t&aelig;ni&aelig;</i> developed in the human intestine; the
<i>t&aelig;nia solium</i> and the <i>t&aelig;nia lata</i>.</p>

<p>(4.) The <i>t&aelig;nia solium</i> is the species commonly found in
America and all the countries of Europe, except France, Russia, and
Switzerland. In France, both species are found, but the t&aelig;nia lata
seems to be indigenous to Russia and Switzerland.</p>

<p>The <i>t&aelig;nia solium</i> varies in length from four or five to
thirty, thirty-five, or even forty feet. The head is hemispherical and
armed with a double row of twenty or thirty hooklets. The genital organs
are alternate and placed upon the outer edges of each segment. It inhabits
the small intestine, and is usually solitary.</p>

<p>(5.) The <i>t&aelig;nia lata</i>, or broad tape-worm, is distinguished
by the greater breadth of its segments, and the location of the genital
organs, which are found in the centre of each segment. Its small elongated
head is unarmed, and has a longitudinal fissure on each side. It usually
attains a greater length than the <i>t&aelig;nia solium</i>.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The symptoms which the long worms occasion, are
frequently somewhat obscure. Thirst, irregular appetite, colicky pains,
excessive flow of saliva, enlargement of the abdomen, itching of the nose,
pallor of the face, offensive breath, disturbed sleep, and grinding of the
teeth, all are common symptoms. Occasionally, convulsions and other nervous
affections are produced by the presence of the <i>ascaris lumbricoides,</i>
but generally they produce less constitutional disturbance than the other
varieties. The passage of this species of worms from the bowels, or their
ejection from the stomach, is the only positive evidence of their presence.
The <i>ascaris vermicularis</i>, thread, pin, or seat-worm, gives rise to
most of the symptoms produced by the long worms, but in addition produces
intense itching at the anus, and, not unfrequently, an eruption upon that
part. The itching is particularly distressing at night. When the little
sufferer is well covered, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563"
id="Page_563"></a>[pg 563]</span>warmth occasioned by the bed-clothes
causes these little parasites to crawl out upon the anus, and produces such
paroxysms of itching and pain as to cause the child to kick the covering
oft and lie naked. The persistent manifestations of a disposition to lie
naked, should excite the parents' suspicions of seat-worms, and lead them
to investigate all the symptoms. By examining the child's stools the worms
may he found adhering to the feces, and they may also be seen on the anus.
Thousands of children suffer untold agony from these little seat-worms,
which are left unmolested to torment them, because the parents are
unfamiliar with the meaning of the symptoms manifested, and therefore pay
no heed to them. We have been thus particular in describing the symptoms
indicating the presence of these pestiferous parasites, in order that they
may be readily detected.</p>

<p><i>The Symptoms</i> produced by the tape-worm are dizziness, ringing in
the ears, increased secretion of saliva, indigestion, ravenous appetite,
sharp abdominal pains, and emaciation. The only positive sign of the
presence of these parasites, is the passage of pieces of them in the feces.
The nervous and other symptoms produced by the ordinary long worms are also
caused by the tape-worm.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Careful observations have proved that there are certain
causes which favor the generation or development of intestinal worms. Among
others, we may mention fatty or farinaceous articles of food, gormandizing,
constant exposure to a moist atmosphere, and sedentary habits.</p>

<p>It is now generally conceded that the development of tape-worms is due
to the swallowing of an egg or germ-cell, which is contained in many kinds
of animal food, and which the process of cooking has failed to destroy.
People living near low marshes, lakes, or the seacoast, are liable to
<i>t&aelig;ni&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The expulsion of the <i>ascaris lumbricoides</i> may
be very easily and pleasantly effected. Santonin is an effectual remedy for
this variety of worms. For a child three years old, take santonin, six
grains; podophyllin, one grain; white sugar, thirty grains; mix, triturate,
and divide into twelve powders, and give one every three or four hours,
until they act upon the bowels; or take santonin, ten grains; white sugar,
twenty grains; mix, triturate, and divide into ten powders, and give one
every night at bed-time, and after giving two or three in this way,
administer a mild cathartic. As santonin is almost entirely tasteless, if
not combined with other medicines which are unpalatable, no difficulty will
be experienced in administering it to children. By reference to the article
on anthelmintics in this volume, other valuable vermifuges may be selected,
and directions found for their employment.</p>

<p>In the removal of thread or pin-worms, anthelmintic medicines taken into
the stomach are of little or no value. An injection of a strong solution of
salt, is a very efficient remedy. A teaspoonful of turpentine in half a
pint of milk makes a good injection. Strong coffee has been <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564"></a>[pg
564]</span>recommended as an injection. The anus should be well anointed
with vaseline, lard, oil, or fresh butter, after each movement of the
bowels. Whatever injection or remedy is used, it should be followed by the
application of some ointment to the anus, otherwise they will continue to
deposit their eggs about that orifice and multiply there.</p>

<p>Various remedies have been used to destroy tape-worms. Among others we
may mention the old and time-honored remedy, which consists of two or three
ounces of the oil of turpentine, taken in castor oil or some aromatic
tincture.</p>

<p>A decoction made by boiling two or three ounces of freshly powdered
pomegranate bark in a pint of water was used by the ancients, and is now
highly recommended as a remedy.</p>

<p>Some American physicians have used an emulsion of pumpkin seeds with
marked success.</p>

<p>Twenty or thirty grains of the extract of male fern, followed by a
cathartic is highly recommended for the destruction and removal of
t&aelig;ni&aelig;.</p>


<h3>TRICHINA SPIRALIS.</h3>


<p>In 1835, Owen discovered a peculiar parasite, which sometimes infests
the human body, and is termed the <i>trichina spiralis</i>. The presence of
these parasites has given rise to morbid conditions of the system, followed
by the most serious results. They are developed in the alimentary canal,
and then perforate its tissues and enter the muscles. Twelve trichin&aelig;
have been found in a section of human muscle only one-twelfth of an inch
square and one-fifth of an inch in thickness.</p>

<p>The early symptoms of trichin&aelig; are very uncertain, being the same
as those of some other disease. The patient complains of severe pain in the
abdomen and is troubled with diarrhea. When the trichin&aelig; pass into
the muscles, they occasion great suffering. There are sharp pains in the
muscles, the perspiration is profuse, and the patient becomes
exhausted.</p>

<p><b>Cause</b>. Nearly every case of trichin&aelig;, which has been
brought to the notice of the profession, has been attributed to the eating
of raw or improperly cooked pork. The parasites can only be detected with a
microscope.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The impossibility of removing the trichin&aelig; after
they have passed into the muscles is apparent; and, as yet, no special
remedy has been recommended to remove them from the alimentary canal. The
only safety lies in prevention. Hence raw or imperfectly cooked pork should
never be eaten.</p>

<h2>DYSPEPSIA.</h2>


<p>It is generally conceded that a multitude of human ailments arise from
<i>indigestion</i>, and in its various forms it taxes the skill of the
physician to prescribe the proper remedies. It is undeniable that the
closest intimacy exists between happiness and good digestion. A healthy
digestion aids materially in making a cheerful disposition, and the "feast
of reason and flow of soul" is due as much to the functional integrity of
the stomach as to a strong and generous mental organization. Dr. Johnson
severely said: "<i>Every man is a rascal as soon as he is sick.</i>" We all
know that a morbid condition irritates the individual and excites sarcastic
and disagreeable remarks. And, likewise, an irritable temper and, suddenly
aroused passions may not only turn and disturb the stomach, but even poison
the secretions. Anxiety, excitability, fear, and irritability frequently
cause the perversion of physiological processes.</p>

<p>The slightest functional disturbance of the stomach deranges, more or
less, all the succeeding operations of digestion and tends to the vitiation
and impairment of the delicate processes of nutrition. Dyspepsia may
commence and proceed so insidiously as not to excite the suspicion of
friends, although the patient generally desires active treatment, such as
cathartics, emetics, and medicines to act upon the liver. When the disease
becomes confirmed, it presents some of the following symptoms: Weight,
uneasiness, and fullness in the region of the stomach, attended by
impatience, irritability, sluggishness, anxiety, and melancholy; there is
impairment of the appetite and taste, also sourness, flatulency, and,
perhaps, frequent attacks of colic, loss of hope, courage, and energy;
apathy, drowsiness, and frightful dreams are also symptoms common in the
different stages of this disease. There are, furthermore, the accompanying
symptoms of a coated tongue, bitter taste in the mouth, unpleasant
eructations, scalding of the throat from regurgitation, offensive breath,
sick headache, giddiness, disturbed sleep, sallow countenance, heart-burn,
morbid craving after food, constant anxiety and apprehension, fancied
impotency, and fickleness. The subjects of dyspepsia frequently imagine
that they require medicines to act upon the liver, desire active treatment,
are endlessly experimenting in diet, daily rehearse their symptoms, and are
morbidly sensitive.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Overtasking the body or mind, overloading the stomach,
the use of improper food, such as stale vegetables and meat, unripe fruits,
indigestible articles, improperly prepared food, irregular meals,
disorderly habits, the use of alcoholic stimulants, loss of sleep,
masturbation irritability of temper, anxiety, or grief may all give rise to
indigestion. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566"></a>[pg
566]</span>If the functions performed by the skin are embarrassed by cold,
tight clothing, or lack of cleanliness, the nutritive changes cannot
properly take place throughout the body, and consequently the digestive
functions are embarrassed, as the revolutions of a water-wheel are impeded
by the backset of the water. When food is not thoroughly masticated, it is
not properly mixed with saliva of the glands of the mouth, and is not
prepared for digestion by the acids of the stomach.</p>

<p>Whatever diminishes the general strength, impairs the health, or
encroaches upon the functions of life, also hinders the perfect solution of
food and disturbs in a measure the function of digestion. Whatever
diminishes the normal amount of the digestive secretions or perverts their
quality, deteriorating their solvent properties, is a cause of dyspepsia.
This should be borne in mind in selecting remedies.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The hygienic treatment consists in the regulation of
the daily habits, proper selection and preparation of the food, cultivation
of cheerfulness, diversion of the mind, and cleanliness of person. We
cannot give particular directions as to the kind of diet, as there are no
established rules for guidance. Generally, a dyspeptic knows best, from
experience, what articles of diet can be taken with the least injury. The
directions applicable to the condition of one patient, are not suited to
those of another. In dyspepsia, animal food is, as a rule, preferable.
Foods rich in starchy matter often ferment and produce distress. Sometimes
alkalies may be given with beneficial effect, when there seems to be an
excess of acid in the gastric secretions.</p>

<p>In some cases, the digestive fluids are weak and fermentation results,
giving rise to flatulency and belching. An antiseptic, which may be
prepared by mixing a teaspoonful of hydrochloric acid with four ounces of
water, of which a teaspoonful may be taken after each meal, will prove
beneficial to check the fermentation and aid digestion. The addition of one
or two drops of a mixture of one part of carbolic acid and six of
glycerine, to the above solution of hydrochloric acid improves its
antiseptic properties. Or, Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery will stop
undue fermentation, and from its tonic and invigorating effect upon the
lining membranes of the stomach will generally overcome the indigestion.
Some people are afraid to take it, when suffering from indigestion, because
it has a sweet taste. But the sweet is not saccharine, or sugar sweet, but
an entirely different sweet principle which prevents fermentation instead
of promoting it.</p>

<p>Acidity of the stomach and the attendant irritation may be allayed by
the following mixture: Calcined magnesia, one drachm; refined sugar, one
drachm; subnitrate of bismuth, one-half drachm; oil of cajeput, ten drops.
The dose is half a teaspoonful an hour after every meal. Any dispensing
druggist can put it up.</p>

<p>It is frequently difficult to prevent the patient from over-distending
the stomach, and thus impairing the tone of the muscular coats and
prolonging the process of digestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567"></a>[pg
567]</span>In consequence of debility, over-exertion, anxiety, or chronic
inflammation of the stomach, there is not a proper secretion, in quantity
or quality, of digestive solvents, and it matters not whether it be a
deficiency of the fluids of the stomach, or of the intestines, or of the
pancreas and liver, the result is indigestion. The question of what
important agent is lacking, naturally presents itself to the physician. Is
it <i>pepsin</i>, the active principle of the gastric juice, which converts
proteids into peptone, that is wanting, or is there a deficiency of
<i>pancreatin</i>? Of course the principle which is lacking should be
supplied; but has the physician the remedial agents properly prepared, and
ready for prescribing? The specialist, having more cases of dyspepsia to
treat than the general practitioner, is more likely to have the latest and
most approved remedies applicable to loss of appetite, indigestion,
impoverished blood, imperfect assimilation, and all diseases arising from
faulty nutrition. In ordinary practice, the physician's time is divided in
his consideration of acute, chronic, surgical, and obstetrical cases; in
fact, much of it is occupied in riding to reach his patients. His attention
is continually diverted from one class of cases to another, effectually
preventing investigation in any particular direction. His patronage does
not warrant him in the outlay of time required for the investigation of
particular diseases, and the expense necessary to obtain the latest and
best remedial agents for their treatment. In the multiplicity of his cares
and arduous duties by night and by day, obstinate chronic cases become an
annoyance to him, and whenever he can be otherwise professionally employed,
he avoids them, disliking to undertake their treatment.</p>

<p>With plenty of time for scientific investigation, ample facilities to
meet the demands upon his skill, and each succeeding case presenting some
new phase, the treatment becomes a matter of absorbing interest to the
specialist, and each success inspires greater confidence. We not only use
in the treatment of indigestion, solvent remedies, like pepsin, which act
only upon proteids, but also other remedies of recent discovery, which
exert a remarkable curative influence in diseases of the digestive
organs.</p>

<p>The chemistry of digestion and of life is becoming better understood.
Any of the free acids may serve to dissolve a precipitated phosphate; but
it is only the investigating therapeutist and experienced practitioner who
understands which of them is the <i>most</i> and which is the <i>least</i>
efficacious. Alkalies may dissolve lithic deposits, but who, unless he be
an experienced physician, can detect the fault of nutrition which leads to
their formation, or rightly interpret the symptoms indicating it? These
simple illustrations of the complications which attend dyspepsia, are
mentioned merely to show that they must be anticipated and taken into
account in the treatment.</p>

<p>The number of cases of dyspeptic invalids treated by the staff of the
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute within file past few years, is so
large as scarcely to be credited by those unacquainted with the prevalence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568"></a>[pg
568]</span>of this disease. For this reason we have taken unusual pains to
investigate the causes of the disease, and have spared no expense to
provide the most approved digestive solvents, and stomachic tonics, which
invigorate the mucous membrane of the stomach, and materially assist in
reducing the food to a liquid condition. Some of these, without being
purgative, increase the activity of the liver, and stimulate the intestinal
secretions, two very important indications which should be fulfilled by
remedies which cause no real depression. The recent important discoveries
made in obtaining the active principles from indigenous plants, has opened
the way to the use of a few of the most important of these remedial agents,
hitherto almost wholly unknown to the medical profession, and the
encouraging results attending our practice have amply repaid us for the
investigation and originality in our treatment of this affection.</p>

<p>A careful chemical and microscopical examination of the urine often
discloses the actual morbid conditions which perpetuate this functional
disease.</p>


<h3>CHRONIC DIARRHEA.</h3>


<p>On account of the frequency and importance of chronic diarrhea, we deem
it worthy of special consideration. It is frequently the sequel of the
acute form of the affection. The urgent and severe symptoms of acute
diarrhea are often abated, but the disease is not completely cured. The
bowels are left in an irritable condition, perhaps in a state of chronic
ulceration, which perpetuates morbid discharges.</p>

<p>The most noticeable symptom is the tendency to frequent and unhealthy
discharges from the intestines. The evacuated matter varies much in
appearance and character in different cases. The precise location of the
morbid conditions which give rise to the discharges, as well as to their
extent, modifies the color, consistency, and ingredients of the stools.
Most frequently they are dark colored and of very offensive odor. They are
of a more liquid character than is natural, except when, as is sometimes
the case, periods of constipation alternate with periods of unnatural
looseness. Tormina, or griping, is usually present, but not so severe as in
the acute affection. Tenesmus, or straining, often accompanies it. The
appetite is impaired, there is general debility, and the patient is nervous
and irritable. The complexion becomes sallow, the skin dry and rough, the
tongue dark colored, and the body emaciated.</p>

<p>The affection may be the sequel of neglected or badly treated acute
diarrhea, may arise from the injudicious use of powerful purgative
medicines, may result from dissipation, unwholesome food, bad air, absence
of light, long continued exposure to dampness and cold, overwork, and
extreme mental anxiety. Sometimes it is associated with other diseases,
such as Bright's disease of the kidneys, scurvy, or some of the various
forms of scrofulous disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569"></a>[pg
569]</span>The more prominent symptoms are so apparent and so
characteristic that the most unskilled may be able to decide whether the
patient has chronic diarrhea; but to determine in what portion of the
intestinal canal the affection is chiefly seated, to decide upon the extent
of its ravages, to ascertain what peculiar shade or type the affection has
taken on, to investigate its complications and modifications, to ferret out
its producing or aggravating causes, and above all, to nicely and
skillfully adjust remedies to meet the depraved conditions, is by no means
an easy task, even for the educated and experienced physician. It should be
borne in mind that this is a dangerous malady, and one which should not be
trifled with or neglected. Its tendency is to corrode and destroy the
bowels, a process which if unchecked, must sooner or latter result in
death. There is little tendency to spontaneous recovery, nor is a removal
of the exciting cause often followed by recovery. The disease becomes so
firmly seated, and the powers of life so debilitated, that nature cannot
rally.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. A warm, salt bath, several times a week, taken at
bed-time, is beneficial. Flannel should be worn next to the skin, and the
sleeping-room should be warm and well ventilated.</p>

<p>As will be seen from testimonials hereinafter inserted, Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery has achieved great success in curing chronic
diarrhea. Its use should be persisted in for a considerable time to
strengthen and tone up the bowels. To relieve the discharges, take Dr.
Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart Weed, as needed from time to time.</p>


<h3>CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER.</h3>

<h4>(CHRONIC HEPATITIS.)</h4>


<p>This is what is ordinarily termed <i>liver complaint, torpid liver, and
bilious disorder</i>.</p>

<p>Under this head may be considered all those chronic affections known as
congestion, induration, and enlargement of the liver, and which result in
deficient action, functional derangement, morbid secretion of bile, and
various chronic affections.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. Owing to the liability of other organs to become
diseased during the progress of chronic affections of the liver, great
precision in diagnosis is required to determine, by the symptoms, the organ
which is <i>primarily</i> diseased and those secondarily affected. This
requires not only familiarity with the signs of a complicated disease, but
also thorough anatomical knowledge of the diseased organ, of the morbid
changes which occur in its structure, and their influence on its own
functions, as well as on those of other organs.</p>

<p>The symptoms may differ according to the circumstances, temperament,
sex, age, or constitution of the individual, and the complications of the
disease. The local indications are fullness of the right side, thus
denoting congestion of the liver; a dull, heavy pain, which is increased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570"></a>[pg
570]</span>by pressure or by lying on the left side; a sense of fullness,
weight, and oppression about the stomach; an aching in the right
shoulder-blade; a dull, disagreeable pain in the shoulder-joint, which may
extend down the arm, and which is sometimes felt in the wrist and joints of
the hand Not unfrequently the complexion becomes pale and sallow, and there
is puffiness under the eye, headache, a bitter taste in the mouth, tongue
coated white or covered with a brown fur, and hardness of the gums; there
is frequent sighing, a hacking cough, fever, restlessness, and loss of
sleep; sometimes an unnatural, greasy appearance of the skin, at others, it
is dry and harsh, has scaly or branny eruptions, pimples, dark blotches,
and troublesome itching. The urine is frequently scanty and high-colored,
but variable as to quantity and appearance; it often produces a scalding
sensation when voided, and, if allowed to stand, deposits a sediment which
sometimes contains albumen. The pulse is very slow, particularly when the
elements of the bile are not eliminated from the blood. The pulsations of
the heart are easily quickened, and palpitation is excited if the subject
be low and an&aelig;mic. There is depression of spirits, and a decided
tendency to be discouraged and despondent. The functional powers of the
stomach are impaired; there is loss of appetite, or it becomes capricious;
uneasiness is felt in the region of the stomach, oppression, sometimes
nausea and water-brash, or there is indigestion, flatulency, and acid
eructations; the bowels become irregular, usually constipated, and
occasionally subject to obstinate diarrhea attended with colicky pains; the
stools are of a light clay color, sometimes hard and dark, again thin and
very offensive, and occasionally green or black. As the disease progresses,
during the day the circulation is sluggish, the feet and hands are cold,
but at night the pulse is accelerated, and a burning sensation is felt in
the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.</p>

<p>The foregoing symptoms are not all present in one case, nor are any two
cases alike in every respect. They vary according to the organs most
implicated in the hepatic derangement. Thus, when chronic inflammation of
the liver is associated with <i>heart</i> disease, the subject may have
palpitation, excessive or defective action of the heart, attended with more
or less pain and shortness of breath. If the <i>lungs</i> be specially
influenced, then, in addition to the ordinary hepatic symptoms, there may
be a dry cough, asthma, hurried respiration, bronchitis, hoarseness, and
pain in the chest. If the <i>stomach</i> be the sympathizing organ, the
tongue is coated white or brown, there is nausea, loss of appetite,
flatulency, acidity, dyspepsia, fullness, and oppression, amounting,
sometimes, to pain in the stomach after taking food; the food ferments and
gives rise to eructations and various other manifestations of disorder. If
the <i>bowels</i> are morbidly influenced by this affection, there is
constipation or diarrhea, griping pain, distension of the abdomen, piles,
and pain just within the points of the hips, thus indicating irritation of
The colon. If the <i>brain</i> or <i>nervous system</i> sensitively
responds, there is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571"
id="Page_571"></a>[pg 571]</span>headache, dizziness, disturbed sleep,
depression of spirits, peevishness, capriciousness, lack of energy,
irritability, and congestive symptoms. When the <i>skin</i> is involved the
surface is dry, harsh, and scaly, displaying dark "moth-spots," blotches,
or numerous little sores, and the countenance has a dull, tawny look. If
the <i>kidneys</i> be disturbed by it, there may be pain and a sensation of
weight in the back, while the urine may be scanty and high-colored, or
abundant, pale, and limpid, frequently charged with sedimentary products of
disease, and voided with difficulty. If the <i>womb</i> be implicated in
this chronic affection, the menstrual function may be deranged, and result
in an excessive or a deficient monthly flow, and be followed by profuse
leucorrhea.</p>

<p>The preceding allusion to the complications of chronic inflammation of
the liver shows the necessity of clearly distinguishing between the
symptoms of this disorder and those reflected by the organs which
sympathetically respond. To discriminate more effectually, and place the
correctness of the diagnosis beyond doubt, we make a chemical and
microscopical examination of the urine, and thereby detect the morbid
products which it contains, and direct our attention to the diseased organs
furnishing them. These examinations together with a complete history of the
case, enable us to make a correct and definite diagnosis of the disease,
and the extent to which it has affected the other organs.</p>

<p>Before entering upon the consideration of treatment, let us briefly
enumerate the functions of the liver: <i>First</i>, it removes matter,
which, if allowed to remain in the blood, would become noxious and unfit it
for the further support of the body. <i>Secondly</i>, by secreting bile, it
furnishes to the digestive organs a fluid which assists in converting the
food into chyle, stimulates the intestine to action, and then is itself
transformed and absorbed with the chylous products, after which it
circulates with the blood and assists in nutrition until, becoming
injurious and pernicious, it is re-secreted and re-elaborated to serve
again, as described.</p>

<p>For its growth and nourishment, the liver is furnished with blood by the
hepatic artery; but for the purpose of secretion and depuration, it is
abundantly supplied with venous blood by the portal system, which is made
up of veins from the spleen, stomach, pancreas, and intestines. This
impure, venous blood, surcharged with biliary elements, which must be
withdrawn from it, is freely poured into the minute network of this
glandular organ. In a healthy condition of the liver, the carbonaceous
elements of the blood are converted into sugar, and the constituents of the
bile are liberated by the liver, and set apart for further duties. When it
fails to eliminate these noxious elements from the blood, it is itself
thoroughly vitiated by them.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. Food must be rich in carbon in order that it may build
up the tissues and keep the body warm, but carbonic acid, the result of the
combustion, must be removed from the blood, or death will ensue. So bile is
necessary to digestion, nutrition, and life; yet, if it be not <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572"></a>[pg
572]</span>separated from the blood by the secreting action of the liver,
it will as surely poison the system and destroy life as carbonic acid.
Although the constituents of the bile exist in the blood, they must be
removed in order that the blood may be rendered more fit to support the
body, while the secreted bile is destined to assist in digestion, and the
mysterious process of nutrition. Therefore, we should induce a secretion of
bile, and restore the normal activity of the liver. This should be done,
not by administering stimulants, but by relieving it of all contingent
embarrassments as far as possible. Would any one think of giving to a weak,
debilitated man large portions of brandy to enable him to work? Does not
every one know that, when the unnatural stimulus is removed, he fails?
Apply this principle in the treatment of the liver. When harsh, unnatural
stimulants and "bile-driving" medicines are administered for a time and
then withheld, the liver relapses into a more torpid and debilitated
condition than before treatment was begun. Is not this true of nine-tenths
of all who suffer from this malady, and have recourse to this class of
remedies?</p>

<p>Then how can we remedially fulfill the preceding indications? We answer
in the language of a distinguished author and standard medical writer, "by
using a class of agents which should never be overlooked in the treatment
of long-standing liver diseases, chiefly addressed to the blood and
denominated '<i>alteratives.</i>'"</p>

<p><i>Alteratives, tonics</i>, and <i>restorative catalytics</i> are
required not only in diseases of the liver, but in a large number of
ailments in which the blood becomes charged with morbid materials. The
active remedial properties of the most efficient agents of the above
classes of medicine now known, are scientifically combined in the "Golden
Medical Discovery," which acts <i>especially</i> upon the blood, and hence
influences the system generally. It is also powerful in eliminating those
morbid humors which are afterwards subjected to excretion through various
organs.</p>

<p>Its action is radically different from most medicines employed in
chronic diseases, for the reason, that what is usually prescribed, is
something corrosive. Unless the disease be temporary, it may return with
increased violence.</p>

<p>We have been very minute in the description of the remedial properties
of the "Golden Medical Discovery," and have relied upon the reason and
intelligence of our patrons, believing that they can, in a degree,
understand why we deem it so applicable to the system. It does not
debilitate the liver by over-stimulation, nor irritate the stomach and
bowels by disturbing the delicate processes of digestion, neither does it
act with severity upon the blood, but it operates so gently, insensibly,
and yet with so much certainty, that it excites the surprise and admiration
of the patient.</p>

<p>From the careful detail of its various properties, there is abundant
reason for its favorable action upon all of the excretory organs, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573"></a>[pg
573]</span>co-operate in the removal of morbid materials from the system.
If, however, the bowels are unusually sluggish or obstinately constipated,
it is advisable, in conjunction with the "Golden Medical Discovery," to use
the "Pleasant Pellets," which are also powerfully alterative, besides being
mild and unirritating in their operation. They are the natural assistants
of the "Discovery," working harmoniously together. They should be taken in
small doses, and their use perseveringly followed, until the bowels are
properly regulated by the use of the "Discovery" alone.</p>

<p>It has been customary to resort to powerful drastic cathartics, followed
by bitters prepared in dilute alcohol. The habit is unscientific, for it is
well known that alcohol deranges the functions of the digestive organs and
depraves the blood, besides creating a morbid appetite. It has been
repeatedly demonstrated that the use of such bitters has led to a life of
drunkenness, with all the woe and untold misery which attend it.</p>

<p>Medicines to be strictly remedial, should exert a tonic influence upon
all the vital processes. Those organs which are contiguous to the liver, or
connected by sympathy with it, should be assisted in the performance of
their functions. Persons who are habitually subject to "bilious" attacks
are pleased to find that the use of the "Discovery" and "Pellets" furnishes
immunity from such onsets, and prevents their usual recurrence. Thus these
remedies are <i>preventive</i> as well as <i>curative</i>.</p>

<p>What we have thus far recommended for the treatment of this chronic
affection is within the reach of every family. Patients laboring under this
disease, when complicated with other affections, require special
consideration and treatment, and all such are counseled to employ only
those physicians whose experience and success entitle them to confidence.
Health is one of the greatest of blessings, and how to restore it when
lost, is a question of vital importance.</p>

<p>Having successfully treated thousands of invalids who have suffered from
this chronic affection, we possess abundant evidence of the curability of
the disease, but we have only space to publish a few letters from persons
who have been under our care, or who have used our medicines, purchased
from druggists.</p>


<h3>CONSTIPATION. (COSTIVENESS.)</h3>


<p>Health depends very largely upon the regularity of the bowels. There
should be proper alvine evacuations every day. There are few persons who
have not suffered at some period of their lives from constipation of the
bowels. Inattentive to the calls of nature, or a neglect to regularly
attend to this important duty, sooner or later, produces disastrous
results. Furthermore, it is essential to the comfort of every individual,
for, when this function is not performed, there is derangement of the
mental as well as of the bodily organs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574"></a>[pg
574]</span>Constipation, or <i>costiveness</i>, as it is sometimes termed,
is a functional derangement of the large intestine. This intestine is about
five feet in length, and consists of the c&aelig;cum, colon, and rectum. It
serves as a temporary reservoir for the excrementitial residue of
alimentary matter, and for the effete materials excreted by the glands
contained in its mucous coats. It is distinguished as the <i>large</i>
intestine, because of its great size.</p>

<p>Habitual constipation produces many derangements, resulting from
<i>sympathy, irritation</i>, or <i>mechanical obstruction</i>. By referring
to Figs. 4 and 9, the reader may observe the anatomical relations which the
large intestine sustains to the other abdominal organs. The ascending colon
arises in the c&aelig;cum (Fig. 4), at the lower part of the abdomen, and
passes over the kidney on the right side, where it begins a circuitous
route around the abdominal cavity, comes in contact with the inferior
surface of the liver, proceeds behind and below the large curvature of the
stomach, emerges on the left side, and passes downward in front of the left
kidney, where it dips into the pelvic cavity, and ends in the rectum.</p>

<p>If fecal matters are retained until they are decomposed, great injury
follows, since the fluid portions are absorbed, conveyed into the blood,
and, of necessity, corrupt it with their impurities. In this way,
constipation may be the source of general derangement, but <i>such</i>
disorder is seldom attributed to the torpid state of this intestine. There
is little doubt but that it thereby imposes a great tax upon the functions
of the liver, and, frequently, the fault is attributed to that organ
instead of the large intestine. Sometimes the blood becomes so charged with
fecal matter that its odor can be detected in the breath of the
subject.</p>

<p>An overloaded condition of the large intestine may cause inflammation of
the liver or dropsy of the abdomen. When the colon is distended, it becomes
a mechanical impediment to the free circulation of the blood in other
organs, and causes congestion of the portal system, predisposing to chronic
inflammation or cirrhosis of the liver. This latter is a structural
affection, and may, in turn, give rise to abdominal dropsy. In a word, the
accumulation of feces in the colon irritates both the large and small
intestines, thus causing congestion of the bowels, liver, or stomach.</p>

<p>The protracted presence of feculent matter deadens the sensibility of
the intestine, so that great stimulation is required to provoke it to
action. The contents become dry, solid, knotty, and hard, and very
difficult to evacuate. If drastic, irritating physic be taken, only
<i>temporary</i> relief is afforded, and it must be repeatedly resorted to,
and the dose increased, to obtain the desired effect.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. One diagnostic symptom of a loaded state of the colon,
is an abundant secretion of urine, as limpid as water. The direct symptoms
relate to the hardness of the feces and the great difficulty of voiding
them. The influence of constipation upon the functions of the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575"></a>[pg 575]</span>liver,
is indicated by the sympathy displayed between that organ and the mind. The
patient manifests apprehension, mental depression, taciturnity, and
melancholy, all indicative of hypochondriac dejection, induced by
constipation.</p>

<p>We have treated patients, who, from this cause, had renounced their
bright hopes, lost their buoyant spirits, and, becoming subject to
superstitious fears, had given themselves up, night and day, to devotions
and penance. It often happens that the victims of this deep dejection and
morbid feeling of self-abasement, are persons not only of good moral
character, but of high religious attainments, and their painful exhibitions
of fear, distrust, and gloom, originate in <i>physical</i> rather than in
spiritual causes. It is interesting to witness this strange perversion of
the imagination, this morbid debasement of the religious faculties, and
dejection of mind, due to causes disturbing the functions of the liver and
other vital organs.</p>

<p>Young girls, as they approach the age of puberty, seem possessed with
the idea that the unfrequent action of the bowels is a desirable habit.
They do not associate with the duty a proper regard for health, but
consider it as an inelegant and repugnant practice. The consequence is,
that at this susceptible period, constipation, induced by neglect, arouses
a latent hepatic or pulmonary disease which has been lurking in the
system.</p>

<p>How many girls illustrate the truth of this statement by their
complaints of dizziness, throbbing pain in the forehead and temples,
flushing of the face, transient flushes of heat over the body, while at the
same time the extremities are cold. At other times, they manifest the evils
of such a course by their stupor, drowsiness, and deep sleep, although upon
arising in the morning, they are still tired and unrefreshed.</p>

<p>The constipated condition of the bowels, often leads to congestion of
the uterus and leucorrhea, followed by uterine debility, prolapsus,
excessive menstruation, anteversion or retroversion of that organ. The
infrequency of the habit, incorrectly supposed to be desirable by a young
woman, becomes nearly, if not quite disastrous to all her desires and
bright prospects. Complications arise, and neither the inexperienced girl
nor her solicitous and afflicted parents know where to look for remedial
aid. If they seek an asylum from these sufferings, they find many private
institutions, where flattering expectations of speedy recovery are aroused.
At such institutions, these uterine disorders are generally treated merely
as local diseases, while the causes are overlooked, and, consequently, a
permanent cure is not effected. Having spent nearly all the money at her
command, the patient returns home utterly disheartened. After such
failures, many of these unfortunate individuals have applied to us and
received treatment, and by persistently following our directions, have in
due time been restored to health, amid all the comforts of home, and among
friends, who rejoiced with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576"
id="Page_576"></a>[pg 576]</span>them in the unexpectedly favorable turn of
affairs, accomplished at a comparatively trifling expense.</p>

<p>We have seen infants, and also young children, in whom constipation was
obstinate. It therefore seems that it is often hereditary. In some persons,
this affection continues from childhood, with but little variation, until
bleeding pile tumors are developed. Habitual constipation of the bowels for
a long period of years will generate a class of diseases, which are often
very serious in their results.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. We have already alluded to a sense of false modesty which
prevents a response to the calls of nature, and we may mention other
reasons, equally trifling, which deter many from fulfilling its demands.
Some are in the habit of temporarily postponing their visits to the water
closet, until, when they do go, they find themselves unable to evacuate the
bowels. Sometimes the closet is a damp, uncomfortable out-house, situated
at a distance from the dwelling, or the access is too public, and, hence,
there is an unwillingness to visit it at the proper time. Some appear to be
too indolent to attend to this duty. Others are too energetic, and think
they cannot take the time, until they have finished some self-imposed task
or attended to a pressing engagement.</p>

<p>Inactive life and sedentary occupations are also causes of constipation.
Active exercise promotes all the bodily functions, and helps to regulate
the bowels. Those who are engaged in literary pursuits, find that mental
occupation determines the blood to the brain, thus drawing it from the
extremities; the temperature falls below the natural standard, and there is
almost invariably congestion of the bowels. The inmates of
boarding-schools, factory girls, seamstresses, milliners, employ&eacute;s
in manufacturing establishments, and all who sit and toil almost
unremittingly twelve hours in the day, do not get sufficient exercise of
all the muscles of the body, and are often troubled with obstinate
constipation.</p>

<p>Food prepared according to the modern modes of cookery, is one of the
causes which favors the developement of this derangement. People live too
exclusively upon bolted wheat flour. The branny portion of a kernel of
wheat consists of various nutritive elements, with more than five times the
amount of phosphate of lime contained in fine bolted flour. Those who daily
use boiled cracked wheat are not troubled by constipation. There is no
dryness or hardness of the feces, and the bowels are evacuated without
discomfort.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. Prevention is always better than cure; hence, a few
hygienic directions may not be amiss. Do not disregard the intimations of
nature, but promptly respond to her calls. If there is constipation,
overcome it by establishing the habit of making daily efforts to effect a
movement of the bowels. Taking regular exercise by walking, and lightly
percussing or kneading the bowels for five minutes daily, help to increase
their activity. The habit of early rising favors the natural action of the
bowels. Drinking a glass of water on rising exerts a <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577"></a>[pg
577]</span>beneficial influence. The food should be such as will excite the
mucous secretion of the large intestines, and arouse its muscles to action.
For this purpose, there is no one article that excels coarsely-cracked
boiled wheat. Graham bread, mush, cakes, gems, and all articles of diet
made from unbolted wheat flour are valuable auxiliaries, and may be
prepared to suit the taste. Take the meals at stated hours; be punctual in
attendance, regular in eating, and thoroughly masticate your food.
Irregularity in the intervals between eating, disturbs the functions of the
intestine. The use of ripe fruits, such as apples, pears, grapes, figs, and
prunes, in proper quantities, is sometimes very beneficial. Trivial or
unimportant as these hygienic suggestions may appear, yet were they
observed, constipation, as well as most of the diseases incident to it,
would be obviated. A large proportion of the cases will yield to the
foregoing hygienic treatment without the employment of medicines. Should it
be necessary, however, to employ an aperient to relieve the constipation,
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery will act most congenially, and will
be followed by no constipating reaction, which invariably occurs when
drastic cathartics are employed. Its operation is mild, bringing about a
healthy action by promoting the biliary and other secretions, thus aiding
nature in establishing normal functional activity in the bowels. Recourse
should be had to it before employing any thing more strongly cathartic.
However, should it prove too mild in its aperient effects, small doses of
Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets may be employed daily to assist it. Unlike
other cathartics, they produce a secondary tonic effect upon the bowels,
which renders their influence more lasting than that of other purgatives.
We cannot too strongly discourage the injurious custom which many people
have of frequently <i>scouring</i> out their bowels with strong cathartics.
It is a bad practice, and cannot fail to do injury. The greatest benefit is
derived, not from cathartic doses, but from taking only one or two of the
"Pellets" per day, or enough to keep the bowels regular, and continuing
their use for several weeks, in connection with Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery, strictly carrying out the hygienic treatment heretofore
advised.</p>

<p>The medical treatment of individual cases sometimes involves many
considerations relative to the particular circumstances and complications
presented. The peculiar susceptibility of the constitution, as well as the
diseases incident to constipation, must be taken into account. Symptomatic
derangement should not be treated as primary, although it is by
inexperienced physicians. If the patient be afflicted with uterine disease,
piles, nervous affections, falling of the lower bowel, or fistula, they
should be treated in connection with this disease. For these reasons, we
would advise our readers to submit all complicated cases, or those that do
not yield to the course heretofore advised, to a physician of large
experience in the management of chronic diseases, and not assume the great
responsibility and the dire consequences which are <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_578" id="Page_578"></a>[pg 578]</span>very liable to arise from
the improper treatment of such cases. We have been called upon to treat
thousands of cases of this troublesome affection, and as a result of our
vast experience, and in consequence of our original and improved methods of
diagnosis, it is not generally necessary that we should see and examine the
patient in person. We can almost always determine the exact nature of the
patient's malady, and its stage of advancement, without seeing the subject
in person.</p>


<h3>PILES. (HEMORRHOIDS.)</h3>


<p>There are few maladies more common than this, and few which are more
annoying. Piles consist of tumors formed within the rectum and about the
anus, by dilatation of the hemorrhoidal veins and thickening of their
walls. Sometimes, when attended by considerable inflammation, or when the
attacks are very frequent, there is thickening of the adjacent cellular and
mucous tissues.</p>

<p>There are two general forms of this disease, the external or blind
piles, in which the tumors are outside the anus, and the internal or
bleeding piles, in which the tumors are formed within the sphincters,
although after their formation they may protrude. The external piles are
commonly made up of thick tissues; upon one side, the skin forms the
covering, while on the inner surface is the mucous membrane of the bowel.
It is this surface which is most tender and irritable and liable to
inflammation. The internal form of the disease is situated from a half an
inch to two and a half inches above the sphincter muscle of the anus. The
tumors are usually round, oval or cylindrical in form. They may be
scattered over the surface of the bowel, or clustered together. The
illustrations (Figs. 1 and 2) show the two forms of the disease. The two
protruding tumors in Fig. 2, illustrate the usual form of prolapsing
internal piles, whilst the one highest up in the bowel shows the form most
commonly met with. It is seldom that one pile tumor is found alone, there
usually being two or three, and sometimes as many as five or six, in a
cluster. Fig. 3 shows the manner of distribution of the veins in the rectal
region. The small venous loops, or bulb-like terminations of the veins H.
<i>i</i>., are the points at which the piles most frequently occur.</p>

/>Fig. 1. Swollen External Piles.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. Whatever tends to favor an undue accumulation of blood in
the hemorrhoidal veins predisposes to piles. For this reason the affection
is frequently a result of diseases of the heart and liver, which cause an
obstruction in the circulation of the blood through the portal vein.
Mechanical pressure from tumors in the abdomen, pregnancy, or an enlarged
or misplaced uterus, is not infrequently a cause of the disease, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579"></a>[pg 579]</span>by
keeping the hemorrhoidal veins over-distended. Those diseases which provoke
much straining, as stricture, inflammation or enlargement of the prostate
gland, and stone in the bladder are also active causative agents. The most
common cause of all, however, is constipation; and persons of indolent,
sedentary and luxurious habits of life are the ones most frequently
affected with this derangement. The following are also prolific causes of
piles, viz.: pelvic tumors, violent horseback exercise, indigestion,
pregnancy, habitual use of drastic cathartics, diarrhea, dysentery, sitting
on heated cushions, long-continued standing posture, diseases of the liver,
worms, the wearing of tight corsets, eating highly seasoned or indigestible
food, and the use of alcoholic stimulants. No age is exempt from piles, nor
is the disease peculiar to either sex. Aside from the serious inconvenience
and pain which are experienced with most forms of piles, there is a
tendency to fistula, and to cancer in the rectal region. It is important,
therefore, that the disease should not be allowed to run on unchecked.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise266"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 2. Piles: internal and protruding. " src="images/advise266.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 2. Piles: internal and protruding. </p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. The most common symptoms at first are slight
uneasiness, such as a little soreness or itching at the verge of the anus,
and at times lancinating pains. These sensations are more severe as a rule
if the bowels are constipated. If the piles are external they frequently
become inflamed, swollen and painful, and in some instances they suppurate,
which usually results in relief. When internal piles have increased to any
considerable extent, or have become inflamed, they produce not only itching
at the extremity of the bowel, pain in the back, etc., but also a sensation
of fullness in the rectum, as though some foreign body were present, and,
on action of the bowels, there is a sensation as though a portion of the
f&aelig;ces had not been expelled. When the internal piles become large,
they frequently come down with f&aelig;cal matter from the bowel, as
illustrated in Fig. 2, and this prolapsus becomes more and more marked with
the progress of the disease, until, in many cases, the tumors are forced
down at each action of the bowels, causing excruciating pain until they are
properly replaced. Usually, in the early stages, they recede spontaneously;
however, after a time it becomes necessary for the sufferer to press them
back, but in some instances this is impossible. Frequently during the
protrusion one of the hemorrhoidal veins gives away, and this is followed
by a free escape of blood, and ulceration may ensue. Not infrequently with
this disease the patient loses strength and flesh, and the face becomes
pale and puffy, assuming a waxy appearance. Many times there is nausea,
with vertigo. Is consequence of the relaxation, the bowel may descend <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580"></a>[pg 580]</span>when on
the feet, or with some extra muscular effort, especially when stooping.
These symptoms may not all be present in one person, and, indeed, sometimes
are somewhat obscure; when such is the case, an examination by a competent
physician will always determine the true character of the complaint at
once.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. Notwithstanding the well established fact that piles
are readily cured by the appropriate treatment, hundreds of thousands of
people suffer untold tortures from them because of the popular impression
that they cannot be cured. All cases are not, however, amenable to the same
form of treatment, for various unhealthy conditions of the system are often
concerned in their production and perpetuation, and must, of necessity, be
remedied by appropriate treatment, before a cure of the piles can be
expected. It will, therefore, become apparent that the avoidance of causes
is of paramount importance. Some of these causes are external, and wholly
under the control of the patient, while others depend upon diseases that
are curable; it frequently happens that while other diseases are being
remedied, the piles disappear Without any special attention.</p>

<p>Diseases of the urinary apparatus, as stricture of the urethra,
enlargement of the prostate gland, and stone in the bladder, dysentery,
diarrhea, and constipation,&mdash;all cause piles, by the irritation, and
determination of blood, which they induce; these difficulties must be
removed by appropriate treatment.</p>

<p>Some years since, we ascertained that we were using in our practice
remedies which, in addition to other virtues, possessed a direct specific
influence upon the vessels concerned in the formation of piles. These
agents enter into the composition of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery,
which, consequently, will be found exceedingly efficacious in the treatment
of this disease. This remedy, therefore, in removing the disease upon which
the piles depend, as a congested or torpid liver, constipation, etc., and
in exciting a direct curative control over the piles themselves, exerts a
double influence. It may be aided, when the bowels are badly constipated,
by the use of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets, taken in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581"></a>[pg 581]</span>the
morning, to secure a regular and easy evacuation of the bowels each day.
All stimulating food and alcoholic drinks should be abstained from. The
cold bath is beneficial in these cases, provided there is not great
debility. The affected parts should be bathed frequently with cold water,
and, if prolapsus exists, it is well to inject a little cool water into the
rectum, and allow it to remain a few minutes. As a soothing, astringing and
healing application to the affected parts we prepare an Ointment that has
acquired great fame for the prompt relief which it affords in all ordinary
cases. This we do not sell through druggists but can send by mail, on
receipt of price, $1.00 per large box, postage prepaid. The persistent use
of this Ointment, at the same time keeping the bowels regular by the use of
"Golden Medical Discovery," with an occasional laxative dose of "Pellets,"
will generally cure all ordinary cases of piles.</p>

<p><b>The Radical Cure of Large Pile Tumors.</b> In cases in which the
tumors have become indurated and very large it is impossible to effect
cures by the foregoing or any other medical treatment. Various methods have
been in use by the profession for the relief of the most severe cases. The
most common is excision with the knife or scissors. Reference to the large
vessels, shown in Fig. 3, which are affected in this disease, will at once
show the sufferer the dangers of this method. The sudden removal of a
tumor, which is connected with one or more of the large hemorrhoidal veins,
is sure to be followed by severe hemorrhage, and many times painful
ulceration, and a fatal result. To avoid this it has been the practice of
many physicians to apply caustics or to burn off the base of the tumors
with a red-hot iron. A more barbarous and painful method could not be
devised. When it is considered that in many cases, this severe and painful
treatment is followed by ulceration, and occasionally by the developement
of cancer, the matter should be carefully weighed before any such dangerous
procedure is attempted. Another common method of treatment is to crush the
base of the pile with a clamp, and then cut off the tumors with scissors.
After this it is also necessary to apply the hot iron to prevent
hemorrhage. Formerly, applications of nitric acid were in common use by
physicians as a means of cure, but it was found that while this treatment
would give temporary relief, yet in no severe case would it effect a cure.
By what we term palliative treatment alone more cures are effected than by
the old process of treatment with nitric acid. Still another form of
treatment is strangulation of the pile by means of a ligature, and this is
often more painful than the application of hot irons, inasmuch as in
cutting off the return flow of blood from the piles, a large tumor is left
for days fully distended and extremely painful. It does not slough off for
a considerable time, and we have seen the strongest men suffer intensely,
to whom the use of scissors in removing the tumors was a positive relief in
comparison with the torture of the ligature. A treatment that has been
highly recommended by some physicians and condemned by others, is <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582"></a>[pg 582]</span>the
process of injection with carbolic acid. This method of treatment is not
very painful but, unfortunately, it is dangerous. The injection of the
tumors with a fluid which causes coagulation of the blood, and which does
not completely shut off the return current of the circulation through the
tumors, has proved fatal in a small percentage of cases. The clots which
are formed by this treatment become detached and are carried into the
general circulation and conveyed to the liver, lungs and even to the brain,
where, by plugging up the vessels of those organs, they cause abscesses
which terminate life. Serious inflammation of the veins is another accident
which often follows the injection of carbolic acid. This treatment is,
therefore, now seldom resorted to except by physicians who do not
appreciate its dangers.</p>

<p><b>A More Successful Method</b>. Fortunately for suffering humanity, a
method of treatment has been perfected and thoroughly tested in our
institution, in which all such trouble and danger as above described are
avoided. This consists in bringing down the tumors, cleansing them and
making application, of certain chemical preparations, that cause the tumors
to speedily shrivel up, and in a very short time, say ten to fourteen days,
disappear entirely. These treatments and applications cause <i>no pain
whatever</i>, for by first applying a weak solution of cocaine to the parts
they are speedily rendered entirely insensible, so that the most sensitive,
nervous lady experiences not the slightest suffering from the application
of our remedies.</p>

<p>Having now at our command means so positively certain in their action
upon pile tumors, we do not hesitate to say that the very worst cases, no
matter of how long standing, can be promptly cured, if we can only have the
patient for a few days under our personal care. Considering the very
distressing character of pile tumors, it is a great boon that we have at
last found safe, painless, and positively certain means for their cure. The
news will be hailed with joy by a large class of sufferers.</p>

<p>Probably no other discovery in modern science is destined to be the
means of conferring greater blessings on a large class of sufferers than
that of a painless and positive method of curing the largest pile tumors in
the brief time required by our system of treating them.</p>

<p>It seems to us that there is no longer an excuse for any one to endure
the tortures inflicted by pile tumors, provided the afflicted one can
command the little time and moderate amount of means necessary to secure
the treatment indicated. Piles are not only in and of themselves very
painful and annoying, but often greatly aggravate and even cause other
grave and painful affections, and should, therefore, not be neglected. When
large, they never get well without proper treatment. We have seen many
cases in which the long train of diverse and distressing symptoms caused by
piles led the sufferer, and even the family physician, to suppose that
other diseases existed, but all of which annoying symptoms were speedily
dispelled by the cure of the piles. We have no doubt that neglected piles,
fistul&aelig;, and other morbid conditions of the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_583" id="Page_583"></a>[pg 583]</span>lower bowels, frequently
degenerate into cancerous disease. We have the eminent authority of J.
Hughes Bennett, of Edinburg, and many other close observers, for saying
that benign or ordinary tumors often degenerate into real cancerous
disease, and our own extensive observation convinces us that this is not
infrequently a result of neglected rectal disease, as piles, fistul&aelig;
and fissures. How important, then, to give prompt attention and skillful
treatment to disease of these parts. When the ordinary palliative
treatment, with ointments and with laxative agents to keep the bowels
soluble, does not <i>completely and perfectly</i> subdue the malady, lose
no time in securing the most skillful appliances, that every vestige of the
affection may be promptly removed. We have treated many thousands of cases
with uniform success, and our patients write to us expressing the greatest
degree of satisfaction, and recommending our method most highly.</p>

<p>Reports of a few cases, selected at random from the large number which
we have cured, are given below to illustrate our success in curing
them.</p>


<h3>ANAL FISTULA. (FISTULA IN ANO.)</h3>


<p>This disease is <i>more dangerous</i> than piles, though, after once
formed, not so painful. It sometimes commences with intense itching about
the anus, accompanied with a little discharge; or the first symptom may be
a painful abscess, like a boil, which finally breaks. The soreness then in
a measure subsides, leaving a fistulous opening, with a continuous
discharge of matter. This unnatural opening, with its constant drain upon
the system, sooner or later is certain to ruin the health or develop
consumption or other maladies, and destroy life.</p>

<p>Fistula in Ano may exist in three conditions: First, complete
fistula&mdash;when the opening is continuous from the cavity of the rectum or
bowel to the surface of the skin, so that liquids, gases, etc., escape;
secondly, internal incomplete fistula, when the opening extends from the
inside of the rectum into the tissues surrounding it, but not through the
skin. A few cases of this kind exist, while the sufferers are unconscious
of the nature of the difficulty, supposing it to be piles or some
trouble&mdash;they know not what. Thirdly, external, incomplete fistula, when
the opening extends through the skin into the tissues around the rectum,
but does not enter the bowel.</p>

<p>Other complications, such as pendulous tits or projections, from
one-fourth to one and a half inches in length, are attendant upon fistula.
Two or more openings may appear in the skin, all communicating with the
same sinus, or opening into the rectum. Sometimes only a small external
opening is seen, while a large abscess exists internally. In any case, the
discharge is not only reducing to the system, but it is disgusting and
offensive.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b> The causes are a constitutional predisposition,
constipation, piles, or the presence of foreign bodies in the rectum,
causing an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584"></a>[pg
584]</span>abscess or ulcer. Some authors have contended that fistula
always originates from an ulcer in the rectum, which gradually makes its
way through the cellular tissue to the surface. Others contend that the
cause of this disease consists in an abscess, which burrows in the tissues
and makes its exit into the rectum, or through the skin, or both. No doubt
it may originate in both ways. It can readily be seen that when an internal
opening is once established, the <i>foeces</i> which enter into it must
sooner or later work their way to the surface, burrowing through those
parts which offer the least resistance, until a place of exit is
reached.</p>

<p><b>Diagnosis</b>. The disease may be suspected, if there has been an
abscess in the parts involved, or if the patient has been subject to pain
in the rectum, and the parts are tender, tumid, or indurated. When the
fistula opens externally, the linen will be moistened and soiled with pus,
or a bloody fluid, and when the tract is large, the <i>foeces</i> may pass
through it. A careful exploration with a probe, passed into the external
opening while the finger is in the rectum, generally reveals the direction
of the tract; but, sometimes, in consequence of the tortuous course of the
canal, the probe cannot he made to follow it. When the fistula is
incomplete, and opens internally, the probe is passed into the rectum and
directed outwards, when it may be felt externally. In such cases, a tumor,
caused by the contents of the fistula, may generally be seen protruding
near the anus, and the pain will be considerably increased during
defecation, by the <i>foeces</i> passing into it and disturbing its walls.
The examination should be made with the greatest possible care, for it is
attended with more or less pain.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. When constitutional derangement exists, it must be
rectified, or any treatment will be liable to result in failure. The
comfort of the patient may be greatly promoted by attention to the bowels,
keeping their contents in a soluble condition, and the liver active, so as
to prevent congestion of the rectum and adjacent structures. This can best
be done by careful attention to hygiene, and the use of "Golden Medical
Discovery" and "Pellets," in sufficient quantities to produce the above
named effects.</p>

<p>A <i>radical cure</i>, however, cannot be accomplished except by
surgical means, for which we have the <i>knife, ligature, caustic,
stimulating injections, etc.,</i> which may be varied to suit the
emergency, but which should never be employed except by a competent
surgeon. Constitutional conditions materially influence the cure, no matter
what procedure is adopted; the greater the constitutional derangement and
the poorer the general health, the longer is the cure delayed. The great
secret of our success in treating this disease consists in applying
appropriate constitutional treatment at the same time.</p>

<p>The use of the knife is becoming obsolete, and has, to a great extent,
given way to other measures which are equally successful. Indeed, other
means will succeed in cases in which the knife fails or is for any reason
inapplicable. One great objection to the knife is not only the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585"></a>[pg 585]</span>dread
which patients entertain of it, but the great liability of its use to
result in paralysis of the sphincters of the anus, the consequence of which
is loss of control over the bowels; and another is that it sometimes
entirely fails to result in cure. By the means which we employ, these
objections are entirely overcome, and, while the general system is being
renovated, the fistula is healed, without any complications.</p>

<p>Fistula is much more common than has generally been supposed. It is apt
to be associated with pulmonary diseases. Heretofore, it has been supposed
that to heal the fistula, during the progress of the lung affection, would
result in fatal consequences, and the patient has been left to suffer and
die under the combined influence, of the <i>two</i> diseases. Observation,
based upon an extensive experience in the management of such diseases, has
proved that supposition to be fallacious in every respect, and we would
urge all persons afflicted with fistula to have the affliction cured, no
matter what complications may exist. The fact underlying this erroneous
opinion is, that when grave constitutional troubles have co-existed the use
of the knife has resulted in failure, and the fistula has refused to
heal.</p>

<p>Having had ample facilities for observing the relative merits of the
various methods of treating this complaint, in hundreds of eases, in our
own practice and that of others, we feel justified in saying that the plan
which we have adopted is far superior to that in general use. The local
treatment which we employ depends upon the nature of the fistula; in some
instances the ligature is best, in others caustics, and again injection,
etc., while still others require a combination of two or more methods, or a
modification of them.</p>

<p>In cases in which it is impossible for the patient to come to our hotel
for a radical and speedy cure of the fistula, we employ constitutional
treatment, with, the use of a medicated crayon, which is similar in shape
to a small slate pencil. This crayon is made of gelatine with the remedial
agents thoroughly incorporated through it, and in an easily soluble form.
They are very flexible and readily used, and where the fistulous track is
sufficiently large to admit of their insertion, the most decided
improvement invariable follows their application. One is oiled and gently
introduced into the track every two or three days, and by its solution the
unhealthy tissues which line the track are removed. They are thrown off,
and a healthy action is induced. With careful constitutional treatment,
decided improvement soon follows, and the discharge is gradually lessened.
The most satisfactory improvement occurs in the general health and strength
of the patient, and gradually the fistula closes. Sometimes it is necessary
to pursue this course of treatment for many months, but the result obtained
is sufficient reward for the trouble. A large percentage of cures follow
this treatment, and we recommend it when it is impossible for the patient
to leave home, or when the general health is greatly reduced by severe
constitutional disease.</p>

doctors called "liver complaint." I tried three different doctors. They did
me no good. They tried about one year; I was not able to work for two
years. At last I thought I would try Dr. Pierce's medicines, and I wrote to
Dr. Pierce, and he wrote to me to take his "Golden Medical Discovery," and
I bought two bottles, and when I took it, I saw it was improving me, and I
got five more, and before I had taken all I was well, and I haven't felt
the symptoms since. I had a continued hurting in my bowels for about two
years. I feel as if the cure is worth thousands of dollars to me.</p>

could get no relief from the doctors of this place&mdash;Randolph, N.Y. I was
induced to use Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, and "Pleasant
Pellets," and after using five bottles of the medicine, I regained my
health, and now I am a well man. I weighed 185 pounds before taken sick,
and I was reduced to 135 pounds in sixty days' time. I suffered greatly
from headache, pain in my right shoulder, poor appetite, constipation and a
sleepy feeling all the time. My health is now very good, and I weigh 170
pounds, and I am able to do a good day's work without any trouble at all.
Thanks to these valuable medicines.</p>

<p><i>Dear Sirs</i>&mdash;After suffering for several years with nasal catarrh
and liver complaint, and having become greatly reduced in health, as a last
resort I placed myself in your hands for treatment. My improvement began
almost immediately after entering your institution. I was enabled to leave
at the end of one month, having experienced great benefit. The treatment
was continued at home for a few months, after which my cure was complete.
At the present time, I am able for office work, and feel that I am
completely cured of the catarrh and have but little if any trouble with my
liver. I shall lose no opportunity to recommend your institution or your
medicines to the afflicted. I do most unhesitatingly recommend chronic
sufferers to visit your institution or take your remedies at home.</p>

<p><i>Dear Sirs</i>&mdash;Some six years ago I was taken sick with chills; I
would have a very bad chill and then I would begin to sweat and vomit; I
had no appetite; I had the catarrh very bad; I had inward troubles of
different kinds; my back ached all the time; I had sores gather and break
inside; I had a lung trouble; I was very bad off; I could sit up only long
enough to have my bed made; my husband sent for our family doctor; he came
three times a week for three months; I was not so well at the end of three
months as when he first came, but kept growing worse; he gave me up to die,
and said I had consumption. I had heard of Dr. Pierce's medicines doing a
good deal of good, so I made up my mind to try them. I sent and got one
bottle of "Favorite Prescription" and one bottle of "Golden Medical
Discovery"; also one bottle of "Pellets," and commenced taking them. In a
few days I commenced to gain, and In two weeks' time I could sit up most
all day, and in five weeks' time I could do my work with the help of two
small girls. After taking four bottles of "Favorite Prescription," six
bottles of "Discovery," and three of "Pellets," I was well enough to get
along without any medicine. I can do a good day's work, and I owe my life
to Dr. Pierce. With God's will and the use of Dr. Pierce's medicine I am
still alive and well.</p>

<p>At the time the case was first submitted to us the bowels were moving
six or eight times a day. In addition to the diarrhea, the patient had
suffered from indigestion and womb trouble for eight years. There was
almost continual pain from the top of the head to the hips and through the
shoulders. There was weakness, soreness and numbness in the arms, hands,
back and hips; the bladder was irritable, urine being passed frequently, or
occasionally scanty, dark, thick, with a brick-dust deposit. There was a
dragging sensation in the region of the womb. Menstruation was irregular,
and she had frequent trembling spells lasting for hours. There was
difficulty in fixing the attention, even for a sufficient length of time to
write a brief letter. In fact, she was so weak and nervous she could
scarcely write at all. Sleeplessness was a prominent feature of the case.
The principal diet consisted of light bread and hot milk; could not use
Graham bread. A course of special treatment was supplied to her about the
first of January, 1890, but soon after commencing the treatment she had an
attack of pneumonia. In due time the treatment was resumed, and then
followed an attack of the epidemic influenza, or grip, so that, although
the treatment was carried on at intervals during a year, there were but few
occasions when our specialist had what he considered full control of the
case. A year after the case was discharged the following communication was
received:</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I should have written sooner, but I waited to see if
there would be any return of my old disease. After suffering over eight
years with severe chronic diarrhea, you have cured me; I have had no return
of it for over a year. It is with gratitude I write to you to tell you the
great good you have done me, for I <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589"

before this had it not been for your treatment; My stomach troubles me very

and a bottle of "Pellets." Hoping that the kind Father may spare your lives
for many years to do good to suffering humanity,</p>

<p><i>Dear Doctors</i>&mdash;It is with the greatest pleasure that I add my own
experience to that of the many that you have cured. I am now seventy-three
years of age, and enjoy very good health for my years, and as you can see
by the photograph I send you, time has dealt very considerately with me so
far as my activity and enjoyment of life are concerned. To this I feel that
in large measure my thanks are due to you, for eleven years ago when I was
sixty-two years of age you treated the pile tumors so successfully. They
had been the source of greatest discomfort. I think that they were caused
first by chronic diarrhea, which had troubled me many years prior to their
appearance. I was also afflicted with asthma, torpid liver and
constipation. These conditions produced in time some pile tumors that were
the source of much suffering, and seemed to continually annoy me. As is
usual with such difficulties, I believe, I would be free from discomfort
for a time, and then the piles would get sensitive and irritable, come down
at stool, and gave rise to severe pain that seemed to affect my general
health. The nervous symptoms that resulted from their presence were such as
to lead me to fear that I would break down in health unless they were
relieved. From information obtained from others who had been relieved at
your hands, I applied to your institution, and can thankfully assert that
the tumors were permanently cured, as it has been eleven years since your
specialist treated me, and I have had no trouble of the kind, and for an
old lady I am pretty well. I had such good treatment and nice care at your
institution that I cannot express in my testimony the thanks that I owe
you. Wishing you every success in the treatment of others, and that you may
be able to relieve the sufferings of many hundreds as you have mine,</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;Some twenty-five years since I was feeling very
miserable all summer; I was very bilious; sometimes my bowels would not
move once in sixty to seventy hours, and then almost impossible. I would
take some bitters, which would help to move the matter, but as soon as the
bitters were gone, I had to buy more or I would be as bad as before, and
sometimes worse; but none of them appeared to do me any good except to move
the bowels, until thirty years since a druggist called my attention to your
"Golden Medical Discovery," and before I had taken half a bottle of the
"Golden Medical Discovery," I felt much better, and by the time I had taken
all, I could eat three hearty meals per day and had not felt so well for a
long time. Soon after I was called to do a job some miles from home, and
one night the old lady there was speaking about her daughter (Mrs. Brooks)
who had been under the doctor's care for about five months and did not get
any better, and I learned by asking a few questions that she had no
appetite and no ambition to do anything. Then I told her what the "Golden
Medical Discovery" had done for me. The next day the old lady drove down to
her daughter's and got Mr. Brooks to send to Rutland, ten miles away, for
two bottles of the "Golden Medical Discovery," and the next day when the
doctor came and was about to take his leave, Mr. Brooks told the doctor he
did not want him any more at present, and would send for him, if necessary.
I saw the old lady about ten days later and her daughter was improving, and
Mr. Brooks had great faith in the "Golden Medical Discovery," and had not
sent for the doctor, but had gone to Rutland for more of the "Golden
Medical Discovery." When I commenced taking the "Golden Medical Discovery"
I thought I was going into consumption, as I had a cough for three years or
more and my weight decreasing. My weight before taking the "Golden Medical
Discovery" was 133 pounds; last March it was 147 pounds, and I give the
credit to the "Discovery,"</p>

during that time had I rest from pain or weakness. I consulted six of our

completely discouraged, as I had been many times before. A letter from the
World's Dispensary Medical Association with questions to be answered, fell
into my hands; these I carefully answered. As soon as a letter could go and
come I received another saying I had the Liver Disease. I could hardly
believe it, for it had never entered my mind that that was my trouble. I
read the pamphlet sent me in the next mail, describing my feelings much
better than I could myself. I accepted their advice, strictly followed it.
I found complete relief in taking the "Golden Medical Discovery." For years
I could not ride a mile nor walk to my nearest neighbor's without feeling
worse for it, and most of the time could not go at all. The day this
picture was taken I rode eighteen miles, walking up and down two long
hills. To the afflicted and discouraged I would say consult the World's

and if there be help for you I believe you will find it in so doing.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;When I commenced taking "Golden Medical Discovery," I
was suffering badly from "Liver Complaint." I had been out of health for
three years. I suffered terribly from "heart-burn," had bad coat on tongue,
and was often troubled with diarrhea. Three bottles of the "Discovery"
cured me. Had I not commenced taking it when I did, I should have been dead
long ago. You have my heartfelt gratitude for my cure.</p>

by the use of your medicines.</p>

had no taste, or appetite to eat anything. I also had such a dead aching in

between my hips. I had been having the "change of life," and if I worked
hard I got a pain between my shoulders and a kind of aching in the abdomen.
I doctored a good deal and never got any relief. I was very nervous. I took
two bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and two of his

<p><i>Dear Sirs</i>&mdash;It is with pleasure that I tell you what your
"Discovery" has done for my mother. She was in poor health for a long time,
coughing and weak, and thought she had consumption; she had such
palpitation of the heart and could not rest at night because of the
palpitation sometimes, and then the right arm pained her so at times that
she hardly knew what to do; If we would put on hot applications, it would
drive it to the heart, and the doctor did her no good; so finally, as a
last resort, we happened to get hold of some of Dr. Pierce's pamphlets and
were constrained to write to him and send a small bottle of urine for
examination. He immediately wrote back, saying it was liver trouble, and to
take the "Golden Medical Discovery" according to directions. She took it
for two months, when the pain in her arm gradually left her and she could
comb her own hair, and began to be more cheerful, for she was melancholy
before. The palpitation grew less and less, and she rested at night, and is
now doing her own work for a family of five, and is sixty-one years
old.</p>

<p>I have taken delight in recommending to others this wonderful medicine
for heart and liver trouble; she took a dozen bottles to effect the desired
end.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I had suffered so much for years from "Liver
Complaint" that I did not care whether I got well or not, but my husband
urged me to take your "Golden Medical Discovery." I had not had my courses
for six months; after I had taken your medicine about two months, I was
well.</p>

<p>When one of my daughters with a baby two weeks old was in so much pain
that she could not rest day or night, I went to her as quickly as I could,
and commenced giving her your "Favorite Prescription." The next morning the
pains were all gone. She said, "oh, mother, I would have died if you had
not come. I do feel so good." Your medicine makes people feel like they
wanted to live. There is a woman at Verdi who had several children who died
with consumption of the bowels and <i>chronic diarrhea</i>. She had another
one who was going the same way. The doctor said it was bound to die. I went
there and gave it five drops of Dr. Pierce's Extract of Smart-Weed, and
increased the dose every time its bowels moved, until I got to a half
teaspoonful. The next morning the child was almost well. That woman says I
saved her baby's life.</p>

<p>I could write a week and not tell half the good your medicines have done
through my hands. Two weeks ago, a young man at my house was taken with
<i>cholera morbus</i>. He thought he was surely going to die, but as
quickly as I could get some hot water, I put hot applications on his
stomach and bowels, and gave him a few doses of your Extract of Smart-Weed.
He got well immediately. MRS. MARY ISABELL FITZGERALD. Reno, Washoe Co.,

prescriptions and patent medicines I have used in abundance; they only
afforded temporary relief. I was recommended to try Dr. Pierce's Pleasant

two weeks. I then reduced the dose to one 'Pellet' every day and continued
this practice for two months. I have in six months increased in solid
flesh, twenty-six pounds. I am in better health than I have been since
childhood. Drowsiness and unpleasant feelings after meals have completely
disappeared.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;In the fall of last year I suffered from rheumatism in
my left shoulder and elbow. I tried a great many remedies, recommended to
me by friends, but they all failed to afford relief. From that time I began
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, until I felt that I was cured, was a
period covering four or five months. While the attack lasted, I suffered a
great deal, and could not dress or undress myself. Although I am 73 years
old, I now regard my health as splendid. I had spent a great deal of money
previously, in various kinds of medicine, but the "Discovery," from the day
I commenced until I was well, cost only FOUR DOLLARS.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;Nine years ago I was taken with severe pains in my
stomach and bowels which the usual home remedies failed to relieve; after
several days it passed off, leaving me very sore and weak but in the course
of a few weeks it came on again. I called in a doctor&mdash;he treated me for
biliousness; I occasionally went several months without any attack and then
it would come more severe than ever; I could scarcely bear the weight of my
clothes on my stomach and bowels. I grew thin, weak and despondent,&mdash;could
do no work without bringing on terrible pain. Doctors treated me for
catarrh of the head and stomach, indigestion, dyspepsia, but all was of no
avail; the suffering gradually increased in severity and I despaired of any
relief.</p>

<p>In 1892 I had a spell that was so severe I cramped from feet to neck.
The Doctor said I must die&mdash;he couldn't do any thing for me. After about
five weeks in bed I could again sit up, but the pain had settled in my
right groin and limb. Relatives persuaded me to try "Golden Medical
Discovery." Two thirds of the bottle was gone when I felt a change for the
better; I had one very light attack after the first bottle; that has been
seventeen months ago and I have had no more trouble. I have taken ten
bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and I am now well and able
to support my family.</p>

<p>To any one with stomach and bowel trouble I will recommend Dr. Pierce's
Medicine. I am never without it in the house.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I am happy to say that your valuable medicine has been
a great benefit to me. I was suffering from general debility, malaria and
nervous sick headaches, and after my third child was born (a beautiful baby
boy of ten pounds) I only recovered after a long illness; I barely gained
strength enough in two years' time so that I was able to crawl about to
accomplish the little housework that I had, by lying down to read many
times each day; had sick headaches very often; and many pains and aches,
all the time complaining of getting no better. I finally asked my husband
to get a bottle of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, which he promptly
did. After I had taken one bottle I could see a great change in my
strength, and fewer sick headaches.</p>

<p>I continued taking the medicine until I had taken eight bottles&mdash;seven
of the "Favorite Prescription" and one of the "Golden Medical Discovery."
For some time past I have not used it, but I am now able to do the
housework for myself, husband and two children (aged nine and five years).
I also take in dressmaking, and enjoy walking a mile at a time, and I think
it is all due to the medicine, for I know I was only failing fast before I
commenced to take it. I take great pleasure in recommending the "Favorite
Prescription" to all women who suffer from debility and sick headache.</p>

Had been treated by many local physicians, who failed to do me any good. I

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;Fifteen years ago I felt the first effect of a
diseased stomach. It was very light at first, but as time went on it
gradually grew worse. I did not suffer much at first&mdash;say for the first
five years; but after that it was continual suffering all the time (and
growing worse all the time), until just two years ago, when I completely
collapsed, and had to give up all thoughts of work. I have not done a day's
work since, but am now ready to go to work again. During the last five
years I have been doctoring with as many as six different doctors here and
in San Francisco. I was with one specialist here in my city five months,
but none of the doctors gave me even temporary relief. The main symptoms of
my disease were that my food would sour on my stomach and give me an awful
heart-burn. I would bloat and have sour risings, and an awful burning
sensation in my chest which would bring the tears. I have felt many times
that I would like to leave this world. In looking over the ads. in the San
Francisco Examiner, I ran across yours&mdash;stating that any one who would send
twenty-one one-cent stamps to the address given would receive The People's
Common Sense Medical Adviser I did as requested, and read a copy, and I now
owe my life and present good health to Dr. Pierce and his noble staff of
physicians. I have now taken fourteen bottles of the "Golden Medical
Discovery" and four bottles of the "Pleasant Pellets," and will say that I
am entirely well of all my stomach troubles. Can sleep nine hours every
night.</p>

it will cure you as sure as the sun shines above.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;For over twelve years I was a great sufferer from
nervous indigestion and acidity of the stomach. I tried some of the best
doctors, both in England and this country, but did not find permanent
relief until I went to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute. The
medicine prepared for me by the specialist at this famous institution was
so effectual that I feel that I am perfectly cured.</p>

<p>I cannot speak in too high praise of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute. The Staff of Physicians is skillful and of large experience, and
the institution itself, in all its appointments, excellent and in advance
of the age. I highly recommend it to all the afflicted, feeling confident
that all the benefit to be derived from medical or surgical treatment can
be had at that institution.</p>

forty-six years old. A pain began in the stomach, a sort of cramp; extended
to the chest, shoulders and arms, also affecting the spinal column opposite
the location of pain; had a hard lump that felt like lead in the pit of her
stomach. Pain was brought on sometimes by eating something that at other
times she could eat with impunity. Attacks of pain lasted usually about
three days. After the pain would leave, she was weak and sore. Sometimes
attacks would come on every day.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I was troubled with chronic indigestion and
constipation. Had to be constantly taking physic, and finally was compelled
to resort to hot water injections regularly to move my bowels. This got to
be a great drudge to me. I took treatment from the leading physicians of
this part of the country for my stomach and bowel troubles, and spent over
one hundred dollars in this way, but they did me no good whatever. I got so
bad that I began to think my time on earth was short, and did not care if I
lived or died. I had to stop work; everything was a burden to me, until at
last I tried your Institution. I went there, and you said you could help
me, and those words sounded so good to me, as I thought I never could get
well again. After taking your special home-treatment for five months, I was
in the enjoyment of perfect health. This was two years ago, and ever since
my bowels have moved regularly, and I have not taken any medicine to make
them move. I cannot find words in which to express my sincere thanks for
the almost immediate relief. I received from your specialists, and will say
I am now enjoying the very best of health.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;For more than twelve years I have been a sufferer with
a complication of rectal troubles; pile tumors, prolapsus and fistula in
Ano. I have been under the treatment of our most skilled practitioners, by
ligature, carbolic acid, constitutional treatment, change of climate and
the celebrated Brinkerhoff treatment, and also tried all of the local
guaranteed nostrums, from all of which I have been only temporarily
relieved. The old troubles would in a short time return, and with seemingly
renewed vigor. With fast failing health and terrible nerve prostration, I
left home the 1st day of October last, to take a two weeks' trip, hoping
for some temporary relief. On the trip I stopped over at Buffalo, and
having several years before been in correspondence with the Infirmary,
concluded to consult you. I did so with little hope of a beneficial result.
From the manner in which I was received and the satisfactory diagnosis of
my case, I placed myself under your treatment. On the 16th day of October
you operated upon me with such complete and satisfactory success, that I am
now a sound and happy man, and am confident that had I been treated by you
ten years ago that I would now be twenty years younger in feeling and
thousands of dollars better off. It affords me pleasure, doctors, to
recommend the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute to all of the

<p>It is with pleasure that I testify to the cure of the Fistula, for which
you treated me. I had suffered from it for a long time, and felt that it
was likely to seriously undermine my health and poison my system. I had
deterred having it treated from the fears of the cutting operation in
common use by physicians in the large hospitals and by surgeons in general
practice. My fears were grounded on the fatal results that had followed in
cases in my knowledge. I am thankful that I placed my case in the hands of
your experienced specialists for treatment. The result has been a perfect
cure. The treatment of the blood-poison that you gave me was successful in
eliminating it all from my system, and I have since enjoyed perfect health,
and no recurrence whatever of the fistula. It has been now many years since
I was cured, and I thank you most sincerely for the good results that were
brought about in my case.</p>

excellent. I was afflicted with an Anal Fistula (a very bad one it proved
to be). I went to the Invalids' Hotel for treatment. Was placed under the
care of your surgeon, who treated my case with such skill, that the parts
are healed soundly. I recommended a friend of mine, who had a rupture, to
go to you for treatment. He did so and was soundly healed of his trouble. I
will cheerfully answer all communications relative to my stay at the
Invalids' Hotel, provided a stamp is enclosed for return postage.</p>

consultation they decided that the knife must be used, which is attended
with great pain and danger. I wrote you and stated my case; you said you
could entirely cure me without pain, also without the use of the knife. I
determined to go to Buffalo. Arrived there the 18th of March, and on the
20th of April I was at home entirely cured, and have enjoyed better health

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I was afflicted with piles for many years, brought on
by heavy lifting during the war. My suffering was extreme, and the pile
tumors gradually increased in size, notwithstanding the fact that I tried
many different kinds of treatment. After becoming physically incapacitated
and unable to do any work at all, and after much hesitation, I visited your
institution as the last resort. I am happy to state that my visit there has
resulted in a complete and permanent cure. A year or more has now elapsed
since I placed myself under the care of your specialist, and I wish to
thank you most heartily, for the attention which I received while there,
and for the cure which has been accomplished in my case. I cannot say
enough in favor of you and your staff of physicians who gave every
attention, and whose treatment has been so successful. All suffering has
entirely vanished, and I have gained about 35 pounds in flesh.</p>

<p>I was troubled with piles for thirty years. These were very mild at
first but gradually increased in severity, and I was unable to get anything
which would relieve them. They gradually increased in size, and for a good
many years past have caused me a great amount of pain. The tumors became of
large size and protruded whenever I lifted anything heavy or strained in
the least; also bled copiously at times. This, together with chronic
inflammation of the bladder, with which I have also suffered for some
years, rendered my life miserable. Physicians at home gave up my case as
hopeless, and said that they did not think I could be benefited, and
certainly not cured. I visited your Institution, hoping to obtain relief,
but with very little faith, and am happy to say that the treatment which I
obtained there has resulted in a permanent cure of the piles, and the
inflammation of the bladder has been so greatly relieved that at present I
have no suffering of any kind. The cure is complete and I feel like a new
person. In fact I have not experienced such comfort in many years. I shall
always appreciate the kindness and attention shown me by your staff of
physicians, and also by the nurses in your Institution, and shall advise my
afflicted friends to make you a visit.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I received a few days ago a communication from you

no photograph of myself taken since I was a child, but will gladly give you
a testimonial and I will answer by letter any skeptical ones that you refer
to me, provided they send a return addressed and stamped envelope for
reply.</p>

<p>Just one year ago, I was suffering untold agonies from internal piles
and prolapsus of the rectum: my bodily pain was so great that the mental
strain was almost more than I could stand. I was useless to myself and
family and had about persuaded myself it would be better to take my life,
and I think I should have done so had not a copy of the Common Sense
Medical Adviser happened to fall into my hands. I was not certain just what
my trouble was, at least what to call it. I began the Chapter treating on
Pile Tumors, and then I realized just what my trouble was. I wrote you and
received encouragement. I sent for a month's treatment and it was certainly
the best investment I ever made. I received the medicines at noon&mdash;read the
directions carefully and commenced at once to carry them out. I seemed
better the next day. I suffered less, and in a few days there was a decided
change for the better. I continued the medicine until I had taken all of
it; I have not taken any since, except occasionally a few of Dr. Pierce's
Pellets, just enough to act as a mild laxative. I am perfectly well. I was
always more or less constipated all my life. I now understand that by
keeping the bowels open and in good order, I could have avoided all of the
suffering that I have gone through; my friends all think my recovery almost
a miracle. I feel, Oh, so grateful to you, I shall never fail to speak a
word in your favor to suffering humanity.</p>

began stinging and my heart began beating badly and making me so that I
could not lift a chair, and all together threw me into a cramp and a
numbness, and the family thought I was dying, and sent for another doctor
who said it was hard to do anything for me; he visited me almost six years
and did not help me; the pain was so great I had to scream; I said to my
doctor, "can you give me something" and he said, "yes, but it will not do
you any good." I told him he had not done me any good in six years, and I
would quit him. I saw I was almost gone, very pale and weak and did not eat

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;My son, aged fourteen years, was taken with bloating
of the abdomen; this would go down leaving the parts so sore he could
scarcely stand. We had three different doctors to treat him, but he grew
steadily worse. We then commenced giving him Dr. Pierre's Golden Medical
Discovery, and after using it three days he commenced to improve. Last
summer he had so fully recovered his health as to make a full hand in the
harvest field. He took, in all, only six bottles of the "Golden Medical
Discovery," and it saved his life.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I had nervous dyspepsia for twenty years, followed by
uterine and spinal weakness with irritation of the same. In the Spring of
1890 I became so exhausted that I was compelled to keep to my bed with
symptoms of paralysis in the lower limbs, and many other distressing
symptoms. I accidentally obtained one of Dr. Pierce's Medical Advisers from
a friend, and finding my ailments so well described therein, I wrote to Dr.
Pierce for his advice, which he sent by return mail. For my recovery he
requested me to use his "Golden Medical Discovery," his "Favorite
Prescription," and his "Pleasant Pellets." He also gave me some directions
for every-day living. These means accomplished my complete cure. I am
thankful that we can have such reliable medicines brought into our homes
without great expense.</p>

<p>DR. R.V. PIERCE: <i>Dear Sir</i>&mdash;When I commenced your medicines, had
headache all the time, indigestion, pain in my back and loins, soreness and
stiffness in my joints, my limbs ached so I could not sleep at night: I
could not lie in bed more than two or three hours any night; when I would
lie my head on the pillow I would have to rise immediately to get breath,
sit up and walk the floor very near all night. I could not eat anything
that would digest; I would do the cooking for the family, but I was in so
much pain the tears were in my eyes all the time I would get a meal ready.
I would take one mouthful of bread and then go off and sit down and cry
with hunger, but dare not eat any more, and then would have to vomit from
that one mouthful of bread&mdash;I would have such weak spells I could not stand
on my feet.</p>

<p>I had tried five doctors, they had done me no good; I had given
up&mdash;never to take anything more, only to lull the pain. I had given up to
die when I received a pamphlet and some papers from you. I decided to try
once more and I have been improving ever since I commenced your treatment;
my health is better than it has been for fifteen years; I weighed one
hundred pounds when I began taking your medicines; now I weigh one hundred
and thirty, as much as I ever weighed. I have taken ten bottles of
"Favorite Prescription" and still more of "Golden Medical Discovery," and
several vials of the "Pellets."</p>

<h1>THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.</h1>

<p>The nerves of the human body are not unlike the vast telegraph system of
this continent.</p>

<p>The millions of nerve filaments are similar to the network of wires that
keep all the cities in close sympathy and communion. The nerves have to
deal with organs instead of villages, and with cells in place of
individuals.</p>

<p>Commerce is regulated and train loads of food supplies dispatched here
and there by telegraph, while in the body the nerves send their analogue,
increased blood and nourishment, where it is required.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise348"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
View on roof of Western Union Telegraph Company's Central Station, Buffalo,
N.Y., showing net-work of wires leading to all parts of the country."
src="images/advise348.png" /></a><br /> View on roof of Western Union
Telegraph Company's Central Station, Buffalo, N.Y., showing net-work of
wires leading to all parts of the country.</p>

<p>The various organs of sense receive manifold impressions of conditions
to be met, food required and dangers to be avoided and the nerves transmit
these impressions telegraphically to the brain.</p>

<p>The structure of the brain, spinal cord and sympathetic nerves, is not
unlike a gigantic and complicated galvanic battery. The number of cells in
the brain and spine are more numerous, by many millions, than those
supplying any telegraph system.</p>

<p>As the blood supplies each cell with its necessary nourishment and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618"></a>[pg 618]</span>removes
its used up or waste materials, so does the workman give each cell of his
battery fresh chemicals from time to time, and removes the used up
waste.</p>

<p>The wires that lead from this battery to every part of the country are
like the nerve filaments that go to each part of the human body and make
them all&mdash;no matter how minute&mdash;perform their functions in a proper manner,
and, when done, permit them to retire to rest.</p>

<p>With the complicated human structure, when disease takes hold, we have
the same troubles that would be presented were the telegraph operators
suddenly to become ill. What confusion and discord would prevail! If the
sickness is severe enough to cause delirium, it would be as though madmen
were at the telegraph keys dispatching trains of passenger cars which could
hardly fail to bring injury and destruction to unwary travelers.</p>

<p>In health, we are unaware of the work of the nerves. The wheels of life
move without noise. Few realize that the cavities of the heart (auricles
and ventricles) are contracting steadily and alternately under the guidance
of nerve cells. By this means the stream of blood, laden with nourishment,
is sent to every part of the body.</p>

<p>Silently the stomach pours out, under nerve influence, its juices that
dissolve and change parts of the food, that it may pass into the blood in
condition to nourish. In a similar way, the pancreas pours out a fluid that
digests the fats.</p>

<p>The muscular fibres of the intestines are caused to contract
rhythmically and force along the bolus of digested food, so that its
soluble parts may be taken up by the minute absorbent vessels to enrich the
blood.</p>

<p>All these things of most vital importance we know least about. They go
on, from day to day, without our being aware of the work done.</p>

<p>Let something interfere with the process, and how quickly is the
sensation changed. Few there are who have not felt the agony of colic pain,
due to stoppage of digestion. What suffering is greater than the sense of
awful suffocation from a heart that is not acting well?</p>

<p>These are only familiar illustrations of a thousand and one distressing
derangements and symptoms that come from exhaustion and prostration of the
nervous system.</p>

<h1>NERVOUS DEBILITY</h1> <h2>OR EXHAUSTION.</h2>

<p>This affection, also popularly known as Nervous Prostration, or Nervous
Weakness, and, to the medical profession, as Neurasthenia, or Nervous
Asthenia, is becoming alarmingly prevalent.</p>

<p>The wear, tear and strain of modern life are concentrated upon the
nervous system. The care and consequent fret, worry and labor of this age
are greater than ever before known.</p>

<p>The result of this extreme activity, is exhaustion and weakness.
Physical bankruptcy is the result of drawing incessantly upon the reserve
capital of nerve force.</p>

<p>We extract the following from an article which recently appeared In the
New York <i>Tribune</i>:</p>

<h3>AN AGE OF NERVOUSNESS.</h3>

<blockquote><p>
The stone age, the bronze age and the iron age, we have heard of; likewise
of the Dark Ages, and other self-marking eras in human history. As for
the present, it might with fitness be known as the age of engineering, or
of electricity, both of which proud titles it has won by its achievements. Yet
there is also a less roseate view to be taken of it, and another title to be
given to it, based upon its too-evident frailties; namely, that it is an age of
nervousness.</p>

<p>Such is the view taken by the famous psychologist, Dr. William Erb, of
the University of Heidelberg. Nervousness, he says, meaning nervous excitement,
nervous weakness, is the growing malady of the day, the physiological
feature of the age. Hysteria, hypochondria and neurasthenia are increasing with
fearful rapidity among both sexes. They begin in childhood, if not indeed
inherited. Minds are overburdened in school, with too much teaching or misdirected
teaching. The pleasures of social life follow, overexerting the already enfeebled
nervous system. Business life is made up of hurry and worry and shocks and
excitements. Society, science, business, art, literature, even religion,
are all pervaded by a spirit of unrest, and by a competitive zeal which urges its
victims on remorselessly. No man knows repose. The result is, wreckage. The
pharmacopoeia is overcrowded with nerve tonics, nerve stimulants, nerve sedatives.
The medical profession devotes its best energies to the treatment of
neuropaths. And as a people we are, or are becoming, excitable, irritable, morbid,
prone to sudden collapse through snapping of the overtense chord of the nervous
vitality.</p>

<p>Nowhere are the rush and hurry and overstrain of life more marked than
in this much-achieving Nation. The comparative youth and freshness and vigor
of the American people enable them to do and to endure what would be beyond
the power of an older and more worn-out community. Yet there is no
disguising the fact that the pace tells even here, and often tells to kill. True, all
the tendencies of the age are in that direction. Inventions, discoveries,
achievements of science, all add to the sum of that which is to be learned, and widen
the field in which there is work to be done. What we need to learn is, however, that
all these things are for man, not man for them. If knowledge has increased, we
should take more time for acquiring it, knowing that, with the consequent
increase of power, we shall be able to achieve as much afterward in the shorter
time as our predecessors did in the longer time their briefer study
afforded. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620"></a>[pg
620]</span>Greater ability should mean not only greater results wrought,
but fuller repose as well. For it would be a sorry ending of this splendid age of learning
and of labor to be known as an age of unsettled brains and shattered nerves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A distinguished medical authority says:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"It is proved beyond any dispute that nervousness is the characteristic
malady of the American Nation, growing upon them in a frightfully accelerated
ratio every year, and threatening them with disasters at no distant date which
the mind shrinks from contemplating."</p>

<p>He continues as follows: "The number of deaths from this cause is
already appalling and is steadily and rapidly increasing. In some of the busy
centres the tables of mortality show that the proportion of nerve deaths has
multiplied more than twenty times in the last forty years, and that now the nerve
deaths number more than one-fourth of all the deaths recorded. What is most
shocking in these returns, this fearful loss of life occurs mainly among young
people of both sexes."</p>

<p>"This means that the Americans are fast becoming a very short-lived
people; and that if they were shut in on themselves for only a few years, without
any influx of vitality by immigration, the publication of the census would send
a pang of horror and alarm throughout the land."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The annual report of the State Board of Charities of the State of New
York for 1894, shows that while the increase in the State's population from
1880 to 1892 was 28 per cent., the increase of the insane in State
institutions for the same period was 83 per cent.!</p>

<p>The enjoyment of the fruits of fortune, earned at the expense of the
nerve cells, is an impossibility. The quiet and harmony of the nerve
centres and nervous system are gone. Rest is impossible, continuance of
work only causes increased jarring and discord of that many stringed and
wonderful mechanism.</p>


<p><b>Symptoms</b>. It is well nigh impossible to give the symptoms of this
disease in an orderly manner, as the affection gives rise to a thousand and
one varying and ofttimes vague symptoms. The particular part of the nervous
system affected, and also the cause and character of the attacks modify the
symptoms. The eminent Dr. Wood says: "Nervous exhaustion may, in the
beginning, affect the whole of the nervous system, or it may be at first
purely local, and co-exist with lack of general nervous strength."</p>

<p><b>Spermatorrhea</b> furnishes many examples of the local form of
neurasthenia, or exhaustion, the sexual centres being primarily affected.
In these cases, however, sooner or later, the whole nervous system becomes
Involved. So in other forms of the disorder, the exhaustion at first local,
finally, if neglected, implicates the whole organism. Often, in brain
exhaustion, the symptoms are at first purely local. Almost always the cause
of a local neurasthenia, or exhaustion, is excessive use of the part. Thus,
cerebral or brain exhaustion, or debility, is usually the result of mental
overwork, while sexual asthenia, or weakness is generally due to abuse of
the sexual organs or to sexual <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621"
id="Page_621"></a>[pg 621]</span>excesses. When to the brain fatigue, or
exhaustion, are added the depressing effects of excessive anxiety, or
allied emotions, the symptoms from the first are more general, and the
exhaustion may effect chiefly a single function of the brain. In pure brain
exhaustion, the loss of a disposition to work, is usually the first
symptom, the sufferer finding that it constantly requires a more and more
painful effort of the will to perform the allotted task. At first, there is
loss of the power of fixing the attention, and this, by and by, is
accompanied by a weakness of the memory; disturbances of sleep are
frequent; various abnormal sensations in the head are complained of. In
most cases there is not absolute headache, but a feeling of weight or
fullness, or an indescribable distress, usually aggravated by mental
effort. It is true that in some cases of very dangerous brain tire, mental
labor is performed with extraordinary vigor and ease; the power of work,
is, for the time, markedly increased, and even the quality of the product
may be raised. The patient may glory in a wild intellectual exaltation, a
sense of mental power, with an almost uncontrollable brain activity. It is
probable, however, that these cases are not instances of pure neurasthenia,
or brain exhaustion, but that there is active congestion of the gray matter
of the brain. In these cases the disease is very prone to end in serious
organic affection of the brain.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise349"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Melancholy. " src="images/advise349.png" /></a><br />Melancholy. </p>

<p>Severe brain exhaustion may be associated with good spirits, but usually
there is marked depression, and this perversion of function generally goes
on, if the disease be not checked, to decided melancholy. The will power,
like all the other functional activities of the brain, is prone to be
weakened, morbid fears may finally develop, and at last, that which was at
the beginning a single brain exhaustion, may end in persistent
hypochondria, followed by insanity.</p>

<p>Peculiar sensations are common in neurasthenia, such as chilliness,
unnatural itching, a feeling as though ants or other insects were crawling
on the skin. Eruptions are common. Attacks of neuralgia are often frequent
and sometimes severe, being usually worse in those persons of nervous
ancestry. In some cases there is a lack of proper sensation, in others an
unnatural sensitiveness. There is also in many cases a peculiar tenderness
over some portion of the spinal column, especially in women.</p>

<p><b>In women,</b> with nervous disturbance of the sexual organs, there is
frequently great pain felt during menstruation; in others, ovarian
irritation and a so-called "irritable," or sensitive uterus, giving rise to
manifold nervous and hysterical symptoms, sometimes culminating in
convulsions or "fits." In not a small proportion of the uterine diseases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622"></a>[pg
622]</span>which are generally only locally treated by physicians, the
local disease is largely and sometimes solely the expression of a general
weakness of nervous origin.</p>


<h3>SELF-ABUSE AND EXCESSES.</h3>

<p>It is well known that Onanism, or masturbation, as well as sexual
excesses, produce an exhaustion of the nerve centres presiding over the
sexual functions. This is the common history of spermatorrhea or loss of
the virile fluid by nightly emissions, accompanied by lascivious
dreams.</p>

<p><b>General Neurasthenia</b>, or nervous exhaustion, may also produce a
local weakness of the sexual centres of the brain and spinal cord, with
symptoms at least resembling those of partial impotency and great
irritability of the sexual organs, or a complete impotence, with premature
seminal discharge whenever coition is attempted. Many times this condition
results from excessive intellectual labor, even with no sexual excesses or
abuses. Nocturnal, or nightly emissions, are not always experienced in
these cases. When they do occur, the debilitating losses of vital fluid
react upon the brain, robbing the victim of courage and manliness and
exciting various phases of morbid fear and sensitiveness.</p>

<p>Many cases of nervous debility, or exhaustion, are the result of long
continued malarial poisoning, diarrhea, Bright's disease, exhausting fevers
or other debilitating affections. Numerous are the cases in which the
patient is able to trace the origin of the malady back to an attack of
influenza, or grip. An epidemic of the latter disease is sure to be
followed by numerous cases of nervous prostration, or exhaustion.</p>


<h3>CARE SHOULD BE EXERCISED.</h3>

<p>In all cases, it is necessary to make careful examinations in order to
detect any obscure chronic disease which may exist. In women, nervous
prostration often develops without perceptible cause at the age of puberty
or at the "change of life." Overwork, especially overwork combined with
worry, are fruitful causes of nervous exhaustion in both sexes.</p>


<h3>AN OVERWORKED NERVOUS SYSTEM</h3>

<p>is always an exhausted nervous system. The nerve cells have been robbed
of their vital forces. All the nutritive organs of the body suffer from the
lack of nerve control, and the blood-vessels that supply the nerve centres
are not in proper tone. Hence the supply of blood and the action of the
heart are greatly interfered with. Many times, the most troublesome
symptom, early in the disease, is an excessive perspiration of the hands
and feet.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623"></a>[pg
623]</span><h3>IMPOVERISHED OR POOR BLOOD.</h3>

<p>A badly nourished nervous system is irritable. Many of the symptoms of
weakness and lack of nutrition resemble those found in congestion, or
stimulation from excess of blood. Then, too, we find sometimes that poor,
thin, watery blood, not suitable for nourishment although sent in large
amount to the brain, does not properly nourish that organ. There will still
be brain exhaustion, as the nervous structures have lost their power of
absorbing the nutrient materials from the blood which, being poor in
quality, does not vitalize and strengthen the nerve centres as it should.
In such cases thought is an effort and sustained mental exertion is
impossible; the memory is uncertain, and the patient drowsy. Occasionally,
after rest, there may be flashes of brilliancy, but generally they are
brief.</p>


<h3>DANGER OF CONTRACTING INTEMPERANCE.</h3>

<p>The patient often learns that a small amount of wine or spirits is a
temporary aid, and sometimes its habitual use is begun in this way.
Stimulants only make a bad matter worse when their use is continued for any
considerable length of time. The sufferer becomes more and more dependent
upon them and the nervous exhaustion is much aggravated as large quantities
are taken to satisfy the morbid craving that has been acquired.</p>

<p><b>Wakefulness, or insomnia</b>, is present in many cases; in others,
there is unusual drowsiness but sleep gives neither rest nor strength;
often it is disturbed by dreams that exhaust the vitality and leave the
patient more tired than when rest was sought.</p>

<p><b>Headache</b> is one of the most annoying symptoms and sometimes is
very persistent. It may incapacitate the patient for the ordinary duties of
life. After laying down awhile and being quiet, the headache may be
relieved, but recurs on attempting to go about.</p>

<p><b>Fretfulness</b>. Sometimes, owing to the discomfort experienced,
there is likely to be a change of disposition, irritability of temper,
fretfulness and peevishness; a tendency to an irascibility all out of
proportion to the real provocation. In many cases there is dizziness, and
frequently noises in the head, ringing in the ears, spots before the eyes,
twitching of the muscles, eyelids or eye muscles, and at times dimness of
vision, or sudden spells when the sight is not satisfactory. At times there
is a feeling of discomfort, as if the quantity of good air were not
sufficient to aerate the blood, and there is sighing or a desire to sit in
an open window, or a strong desire to be fanned. The pulse and temperature
are usually normal, or a little below, but may rise if any local irritation
exists. At times the face is flushed and at others pale. The skin may be
dry, or in other cases bathed in perspiration on slight exertion or mental
worry. When there is weakness of the nervous system, the disease manifests
itself through <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624"
id="Page_624"></a>[pg 624]</span>various organs. Hence, the palpitation of
the heart, dyspepsia or acute attacks of indigestion, with colicky pains
and heaviness after meals, with eructations or belchings of gas, or local
discomfort and unnatural action affecting, at different times, almost every
organ of the body. It is well known that insanity may result from the loss
of sleep and constant brooding over the symptoms that the patient fails to
properly understand.</p>


<h3>TREATMENT.</h3>

<p>In no class of diseases is greater care, scientific knowledge and skill
more necessary than in the treatment of nervous affections. Almost every
case is a law unto itself, and must receive careful consideration,
pains-taking advice and specially prescribed treatment suited to the
peculiarities of the individual. Hereditary influences, causes of the
disease and constitutional peculiarities of the patient must all be taken
into account.</p>


<h3>VALUE OF EXPERIENCE.</h3>

<p>Only through extensive experience can the medical practitioner become
expert at detecting and successfully meeting, by rational scientific and
carefully adapted treatment, the many phases and complications incident to
the different forms and stages of this very prevalent malady.</p>

<p>For more than a quarter of a century, the Specialists of the Invalids
Hotel and Surgical Institute having charge of this department of practice,
have been actively engaged battling with diseases of the nervous system. As
a result of this long time and vast experience, they have naturally
developed and thoroughly tested many valuable remedial agencies for the
relief and cure of this class of sufferers. Many of these can be
successfully prescribed and used at the patients' homes without a personal
consultation; while others can only be brought into use at our
Institution.</p>


<h3>TREATMENT AT HOME.</h3>

<p>Many cases, especially when the exciting cause of the malady can be
easily ascertained, as in spermatorrhea from self-abuse, or sexual
excesses, or in women when arising from uterine affections, can be very
successfully managed and cured at home. This is also true when the disease
is due to the excessive use of tobacco, opium and other narcotics.</p>


<h3>CONSULTATION BY LETTER.</h3>

<p>The patient has thought over his symptoms hundreds of times. The
location of every discomfort has been carefully noted. These matters are
stated with accuracy, common sense and good judgment when writing to us.
The people are far more intelligent in these matters than physicians are
generally willing to admit. A patient is often confused <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625"></a>[pg 625]</span>while
being personally examined by a physician and gives imperfect or incorrect
answers. After he has left the presence of the physician, he finds that he
has failed to enumerate many of the most important symptoms. In consulting
by letter, the patient is not embarrassed, states the exact symptoms and
carefully reads over the letter, to see if it is a complete and accurate
description of his sufferings. In this way he often conveys a much better
idea of the case than if present in person, and subject to the most
thorough questioning and "cross-examination." The timid lady and nervous
young man write just as they feel and one reason why we have had such
success in treating intricate and delicate diseases, is because we have
obtained such true and natural statements of the cases from these letters,
many of which are perfect pen pictures of disease. As bank tellers and
cashiers, who daily handle large quantities of currency, can unmistakably
detect spurious money by a glance at the engraving or touch of the paper,
so the experienced physician, by his great familiarity with disease,
becomes equally skilled in detecting the nature and extent of a chronic
malady, from a written description of its symptoms. To aid the patient in
giving a clear and intelligible history of his case we send, when
requested, a very complete question blank.</p>


<h4>EXAMINATION OF THE URINE.</h4>

<p>A careful, microscopical examination and chemical analysis of the urine
is a valuable aid in determining the nature of these diseases of the
nervous system. This important fact is not overlooked at the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute, where experienced chemists are employed to
make such examinations and report the result to the attending physicians.
Persons consulting us and desiring to avail themselves of the advantages
afforded by these examinations, can send a sample of their urine by
express. The bottle should be thoroughly cleansed and should contain from
two to four ounces of that first passed after arising in the morning. It
should be carefully packed in saw-dust or paper and inclosed in a light
wooden box. All express charges must be prepaid through and a complete
history of the case, including the age and sex of the patient, should
accompany every package, or it will receive no attention. This saves
valuable time by directing the examination into the channels indicated and
thus avoiding a lengthy series of experiments. As we are daily receiving
numerous bottles of urine, every sample, to prevent confusion, should be
labeled with the patient's name. By the postal regulations, all liquids are
excluded from the mails, unless packed in accordance with our printed
directions, which will be sent free on request being received for them.</p>


<h3>WE AIM TO CURE,</h3>

<p>not merely to palliate as is so often done by practitioners in dealing
with these distressing maladies. We do not prescribe coca mixtures, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626"></a>[pg
626]</span>whiskey, malt extracts, so-called celery compounds or other
nerve stimulants, which only spur the already weakened nervous system on as
a man would urge his jaded horse to renewed efforts when the animal should
be refreshed by proper food and rest. Neither have we any faith, in lasting
good resulting from prescribing such nerve sedatives as put the nerves to
sleep and so, by simply blunting sensibility, delude the patient into the
false belief that he is being benefited.</p>

<p>To effect a radical cure of the weakness, the nerve centres must be
restored to a normal condition by improving the nutrition of the nerve
cells. To do this the causes of the difficulty must be understood and any
local weakness or disease of any organ, be it the liver, kidneys, lungs,
stomach, rectum, bladder, or generative organs, must be understood,
properly treated and overcome. The desire for alcoholic stimulants is a
most common and dangerous tendency of the disease. To gratify the morbid
appetite for stimulants is to do the patient lasting injury.</p>


<h4>IMPOVERISHED BLOOD.</h4>

<p>In some cases the nervous affection is the result of an impure, or
impoverished, condition of the blood. In such cases the use of Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery has, in the great majority of cases, resulted in
an immediate benefit and gradually in a permanent restoration of the nerve
centres to a normal condition. This remedy, particularly if assisted by the
use of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets, when constipation is present, unloads
the liver, and their combined action tends to remove from the blood the
poisons which it is the function of the liver to take from that fluid. The
cells of the brain, after performing their function, throw into the blood
certain poisonous materials which it is the function of the liver to
remove. If this is not done, the cells become clogged, and can only be
restored to a natural and healthful condition by increasing the activity of
the liver. This treatment gives rise to an immediate improvement, and a
continuance of the remedies results in a gradual toning up of the nervous
system and relief from the unpleasant symptoms.</p>


<h3>"FEMALE WEAKNESS."</h3>

<p>Many women suffer from nervous prostration, or exhaustion, owing to
congestion of the uterus and ovaries, caused by over-indulgence; again by
overwork, the strain of too many household cares, or too frequent
childbirths. In these cases, the use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription
is of the greatest benefit, tending to restore the uterus and ovaries to a
normal condition. Its wonderful restorative effects, tonic and nerve
invigorating properties, especially adapt it to the cure of these cases.
Digestion and assimilation of food are promoted by its use. When the liver
or blood is not in healthful condition, as previously referred to, the
"Golden Medical Discovery" should be used in <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_627" id="Page_627"></a>[pg 627]</span>conjunction with the
"Prescription." If menstruation be scanty, Dr. Pierce's Pellets will have a
beneficial influence in increasing the flow, and overcoming the headache
and congestion of internal organs that is the result of scanty
menstruation, especially if their use be accompanied with full doses of Dr.
Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-Weed.</p>


<h3>LOCAL CAUSES.</h3>

<p>In the great majority of cases, when nervous prostration has made its
appearance at intervals, with periods of prolonged good health intervening,
but in which, as a rule, slight excesses, over-exertion or the attacks of
some acute disease, produces a nervous exhaustion, we have found that local
derangement is the cause of the whole trouble. This cause may often be
readily removed and a perfect and permanent restoration of the health will
follow.</p>

<p><b>In Men,</b> we have often found a varicocele to be the cause of
nervous prostration. In others rupture, or urethral stricture, sometimes of
a character so mild as hardly to give serious inconvenience, has been the
cause.</p>

<p><b>In Women,</b>, ulceration of the uterus, stricture of the cervix,
congestion or other diseases of the ovaries, such as cysts, abscesses,
etc., inflammation of the Fallopian tubes, characterized with more or less
periodical discomfort and attacks of leucorrhea, or "whites," are common
causes.</p>

<p>In all cases in which the nervous disease depends upon local causes, we
find that the relief of the local source of irritation, which tends to
reduce the general health and interfere with perfect nervous tone, is all
that is necessary to give the invalid a perfect restoration to health,
vigor and activity. It is like removing the burden from a tired horse who
has fallen prostrate under an excessive load. The removal of the burden
puts the individual under a favorable condition for the immediate
restoration to health and strength, and permanent relief is only a matter
of a few days' or weeks' time, with appropriate nourishment and restorative
nerve tonics.</p>


<h3>ALCOHOL, OPIUM AND TOBACCO</h3>

<p>affect different individuals according to their several
susceptibilities. Some are able to withstand, with apparent impunity, an
amount of these that can not be tolerated by others without great injury.
No one, however, is wholly proof against these unwholesome agents which are
in such common use. The sad results of their excessive use are seen in
thousands of cases of shattered nerves and wasted vigor. The excessive use
of tea and coffee is also a prolific cause of nervous affections.</p>

<p>Happily, we have now at our command remedies which exercise a most
potent controlling influence over the acquired, morbid appetite <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628"></a>[pg 628]</span>for
these narcotics and stimulants. Of course we have to depend, to some
extent, upon the will power of the patient, but where this is not wholly
lost, we have in all our later experience, been able to realize a degree of
success which has been alike gratifying to both physician and patient.</p>


<h3>THE INVALIDS' HOTEL AND SURGICAL INSTITUTE SPECIALLY EQUIPPED FOR THE
CURE OF NERVOUS AFFECTIONS.</h3>

<p>Private institutions, well supplied with the numerous and costly aids to
the work of the specialist treating nervous diseases, are now a recognized
necessity. Physicians and sufferers alike appreciate this fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629"></a>[pg
629]</span>Public hospitals do not answer this purpose, owing to the fact
that they are more especially intended for the alleviation of the
sufferings of the poor, and the greater part of the work done is in
affording relief from acute diseases and emergencies requiring surgical
aid. Attention is thus detracted from delicate nervous affections and is
almost wholly engrossed in caring for sufferers from other diseases and
injuries. Besides, association with the charity cases that abound in such
places and the evidences of suffering present on every hand, are enough to
prevent all improvement in sensitive and sympathetic invalids.</p>

<p>Perfect equipment is an important part of the battle in the cure of
nervous affections.</p>


<p>ELECTRICITY IN NERVOUS AFFECTIONS.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise350"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 4. Our large 40 cell Galvano-Faradic Battery with Switch-board."
src="images/advise350.png" /></a><br />Fig. 4. Our large 40 cell
Galvano-Faradic Battery with Switch-board.</p>

<p>Electrical applications, to be beneficial, require, on the part of the
attendant, a technical knowledge of the highest character with costly
apparatus and special appliances. There can be little doubt that
electricity is convertible into nerve force.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise351"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 5. Our Franklin, or Static Electricity, Machine."
src="images/advise351.png" /></a><br />Fig. 5. Our Franklin, or Static
Electricity, Machine.</p>

<p>In treating cases in the Invalids' Hotel, a large variety of batteries,
dynamos and other electrical appliances are brought into use. These consist
of cell batteries, such as is illustrated by Fig. 4, dynamos, operated by
power, Franklin, or static electrical machines illustrated <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630"></a>[pg 630]</span>in Fig.
5, and other electrical apparatus, the choice of the particular machine or
battery being determined by the nature of the case.</p>


<h3>CARE AND SKILL REQUIRED.</h3>

<p>Electricity, like other powerful agencies, in order to prove remedial
must be used of proper strength and in proper quantity. The potential, or
strength, as well as the volume, or amount, of current has to be carefully
measured for that purpose. To accomplish this, we employ an instrument
called a galvanometer, or amperemeter, illustrated in Fig. 6, which
indicates the exact amount of current being applied. For the want of such
instruments to measure the current, physicians often fail to get beneficial
results, as they are not able to administer either the proper quantity or
quality of current. Ofttimes, for like reasons, their hap-hazard way of
employing this powerful agent does positive injury to the patient.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise352"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 6. The Galvanometer, or Amperemeter." src="images/advise352.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 6. The Galvanometer, or Amperemeter.</p>

<p>Of course, in treating cases at a distance, we cannot avail ourselves of
all the great variety of apparatus brought into use at our Invalids Hotel,
yet we have some forms of machines well adapted for home use, and so simple
that, by sending plain printed directions with the machines, our patients
are able to use them effectively without the aid of the physician.
Especially is this true in the milder forms of nervous disease, and when
great exactness and nicety of application is not so important. We show in
Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, two forms of such batteries which are often furnished
our patients for use at their homes. Many times, after cases are under
treatment here for a while, we are able to educate them in the use of the
battery so that by taking one of these home with them they can continue the
treatment with good results after leaving the Institution.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631"></a>[pg
631]</span><h3>ORGANIC, OR ANIMAL, EXTRACTS AS REMEDIES.</h3>

<p>The experience of Pasteur, Brown-Sequard, and our own specialists, in
the use of extracts of nerve substance and of certain glands and organs by
hypodermic or subcutaneous injection of these fluids, has, in a vast number
of cases, been most gratifying to both physicians and patients. Many
wonderful cures have thus been obtained. Injected subcutaneously these
animal extracts are immediately assimilated and we are often able to stop,
at once, the progress of disease and turn the tide towards recovery. Thus
the cells receive the special stimulants upon which their life and activity
depend.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise353"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 7. A small Battery for home use." src="images/advise353.png" /></a><br
/>Fig. 7. A small Battery for home use.</p>

<p>The animal extracts employed in our Institution are all scientifically
and carefully produced in our chemical laboratory under the direct
supervision of an experienced chemist, and are believed to be superior in
quality. They are turned out fresh, as wanted, which is important, as all
such preparations, no matter how carefully made and put up, deteriorate
with age.</p>

<p>These extracts are made from the glands and organs of the lower animals,
as from the brain, spinal cord, heart, testicles, ovaries and some other
organs and parts of bullocks, rabbits, guinea pigs and other animals. That
they possess properties which exert most potent tonic, or invigorating,
influences upon those organs and parts of the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_632" id="Page_632"></a>[pg 632]</span>human system corresponding
to the organs and parts of the lower animals from which they have been
extracted, no longer admits of doubt. In cases of partial and even complete
impotency, especially in elderly men, attended with nervous exhaustion,
most astonishingly favorable results are obtained by our specialists
through the administration of our extracts obtained from the nerve tissue
of the spinal cord, associated with the use of the expressed juices from
animal testes. We do not, however, prescribe these extracts to the
exclusion of other well tested remedial agents, but do regard them,
especially in the more confirmed and obstinate cases, as among our most
positive curative agents.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise354"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 8. A small Battery for home use." src="images/advise354.png" /></a><br
/>Fig. 8. A small Battery for home use.</p>

<p>We must confess that when first proclaimed by Brown-Sequard as Valuable
remedial agents, we regarded the use of these extracts with good deal of
skepticism, but experience is, after all, the best teacher and we were
forced, after numerous successful tests, to admit their great efficacy. We
have always endeavored to keep up with the vanguard of the army of medical
reform, and so took early occasion to introduce these agents into our
practice and made preparations to produce them in our laboratory.</p>

<p>From an article written by an eminent specialist in nervous diseases,
and recently published in the New York <i>Medical Journal</i>, we extract
the following:</p>

<blockquote><p></p>
"Organic beings possess the power of assimilating from the nutritious
matters
they absorb the peculiar pabulum which each organ of the body demands for
the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633"></a>[pg
633]</span>development and sustenance. The brain, for instance, selects
that part which it
requires, the heart the material necessary for its growth and preservation,
and so
on with the liver, the lungs, the muscles, and the various other organs of
the
body. No mistake is ever committed. The brain never takes liver nutriment,
nor the liver brain nutriment; but each selects that which it requires.
There are,
however, diseased conditions of the various organs in which this power is
lost or
impaired, and, as a consequence, disturbance of function, or even death
itself, is
the result."

<p>"Now, if we can obtain the peculiar matter that an organ of the body
requires</p>
and inject it directly into the blood, we do away with the performance of
many
vital processes which are accomplished only by the expenditure of a large
amount
of vital force."

<p>"Let us suppose a person suffering from an exhausted brain, the result
of</p>
excessive brain-work. Three hearty meals are eaten every day, but, no
matter
how judiciously the food may be arranged, the condition continues. Now, if
we
inject into that person's blood a concentrated extract of the brain of a
healthy
animal, we supply at once the pabulum which the organ requires. Then, if
under
this treatment the morbid symptoms disappear, we are justified in
concluding
that we have successfully aided Nature in doing that which, unassisted, she
could
not accomplish."

<p>"That is the system. I believe it is applicable not only to the brain,
but to all</p>
the other organs of the body."
</blockquote>

<p>The writer of the above is, very probably, a little over sanguine in his
opinion that the plan of treatment will prove efficacious in all organic
diseases, but certainly, from our experience, we can endorse his belief as
to its great efficacy in many forms of organic weakness, especially those
of the generative organs, nervous system, heart and some other parts of the
body. We believe that we are placing a conservative estimate upon the
remedial value of these animal juices, or extracts, when we say that they
are destined to fill an important place in the curative resources of the
specialist in chronic diseases.</p>

<p>Under the head of epilepsy, also in connection with our consideration of
locomotor ataxia, we shall have occasion to refer to the use of these
extracts as applicable to the cure of those maladies.</p>

<p>Most cases of nervous diseases that come to us, for examination and
treatment, do so after having tried, without success, treatment by baths,
enforced seclusion, as well as unskillfully applied electrical treatment
and massage. Prolonged medication has frequently aroused digestive
disorders and made the patient hate the sight of the medicine bottle. In
such cases our improved methods, as applied in the Institution and also
prescribed for patients at a distance, enable our specialists to give
relief and effect cures with a minimum of medicine. They also enable us to
treat many cases of nervous diseases heretofore regarded as almost
hopeless, such as locomotor ataxia, paralysis, epilepsy and spinal
affections, with a degree of success which has been very gratifying alike
to physicians and patients.</p>

<h1>HEADACHE AND NEURALGIA.</h1>

<p>There is no ill to which flesh is heir that is the source of a greater
degree of discomfort to the human race than headache. The farmer,
housewife, banker, merchant and laborer seem to be equally prone to the
affliction and all who suffer have a great number of days rendered
uncomfortable and unhappy by the presence of this most unpleasant
affection. Pain is the warning finger of disease&mdash;the threatening
indication of coming trouble. In headache, we have an indication that the
system is subjected to some strain or injurious impression. It may be that
the eyes have been overworked or the brain unnaturally taxed; or that the
nervous and physical systems have not been properly refreshed by sufficient
sleep, and have used up the residue of reserve power. Many suffer from
headache only after they have been subjected to sudden changes of
temperature and have taken cold; others only when the bowels have become
inactive, the liver torpid and the blood vitiated with retained
poisons.</p>

<p>All appreciate the discomfort that results from this malady and
earnestly seek for permanent relief.</p>

<p>Headaches may be divided in two classes: (1) those due to the presence
of poisons in the blood, and (2) those due to irritation of various organs,
as of the eyes, stomach, liver, and intestines.</p>

<p>Of the first form, or variety, of headache, influenza, or grip, and
acute "cold in the head," are the most common causes. These give rise to
most excruciating pain. There is congestion, followed by inflammation in
the nasal passages and cavities communicating therewith. The membranes of
these passages throw out a thin, watery, irritating discharge, which
gradually thickens and becomes pus-like and offensive in character, if the
disease continues.</p>

<p>Poisonous matters are absorbed from the affected surfaces into the
blood. These poisons, circulating in the blood, produce great irritation of
the nerve cells, so much so, that the severity of the attack is felt in the
nervous centres, the brain and spinal cord, with pain varying from the most
acute and sharp, to a dull, numb ache. The temples, eyes, neck and small of
the back, are in their order, the usual locations of greatest pain. Such
attacks vary in frequency and severity. One attack is usually followed by
an early recurrence, which may be more or less severe, while the period of
active pain varies from a few hours to several days. Such attacks leave an
exhausted state of the nerve centres and general weakness of the system
that often lasts for weeks and may permanently impair the system, except
such results be prevented by appropriate treatment. Every recurrence of the
attack leaves the system in a worse condition, until profound nervous
prostration; ensues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635"></a>[pg
635]</span>Malarial headache, sometimes termed "brow ague," is a common
form of the malady with those residing in malarial regions. The pain
rapidly develops, usually over one eye. It lasts from five to ten hours,
and is often of frightful intensity.</p>

<p>Other forms are rheumatic and gouty headache; usually a heavy aching
pain appearing on the approach of storms, but at times almost continuous,
made worse by improper diet.</p>

<p>Ur&aelig;mic headache is due to kidney disease, and alcoholic to direct
irritation of the brain membranes from the use of alcoholic beverages. The
latter is accompanied with much irritation of the stomach and
intestines.</p>

<p>Headaches of a similar character result from the presence in the blood
of an excess of the active principles of coffee and tea.</p>

<p>Overindulgence in these agents, as with alcohol, affects the nerve cells
and membranes, often causing severe attacks of headache.</p>

<p>Nervous headache is another common affliction. This seems to arise from
several causes, such as impoverished blood and exhaustion from overwork of
the brain. Hysterical headache is not uncommon. There is a severe kind of
headache, the attacks of which appear first at early puberty and continue
at intervals more or less frequent in women up to the change of life and in
men to about the fortieth year.</p>

<p>The periodical headache is usually preceded by yawning, chilliness,
languid, exhausted feelings, in others by peculiar emotional or mental
activity. This is followed by unusual drowsiness, in which the night's rest
is broken by dreams, and from which the patient awakes tired. Gradually,
during the day, the headache develops, beginning in the eyes or bones over
them. It gets more and more severe, shooting into the jaws and neck or
extending to the back of the head and spine. As the pains get most severe,
nausea or vomiting, often repeated, follow, in which the contents of the
stomach, with mucus and bile, is ejected. The whole paroxysm lasts from
five hours to two or even three days.</p>

<p><b>Neuralgic headache</b> is a common variety; often the pain is not
confined to the head, in fact neuralgia may affect almost any part of the
system.</p>


<h3>NEURALGIA.</h3>

<p>Neuralgia is an affection of the nerves, of which the chief symptom is
pain. This is of variable intensity and character. It follows the course of
the affected nerve and its branches, and occurs in paroxysms, of agonizing
pain with periods of intermission during which the pain may be very slight,
and cause but little discomfort.</p>

<p>The severe pain is described as lancinating, cutting, tearing, burning,
boring and pressing. Patients use different words in describing the
attacks, and there is probably a difference in the character of the pain,
though in a severe paroxysm one is scarcely able to make a very nice
distinction. We have known cases in which the pain occurred suddenly and
overwhelmed the patient's fortitude by its severity and unexpected <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636"></a>[pg 636]</span>onset.
Between the paroxysms there may be less severe pain, which is then more
frequently of an aching, burning or pricking character. In some, paroxysm
after paroxysm succeed each other with almost lightening-like rapidity, and
even in the intervals the pain is very intense. At another time there is
only one sharp sting of pain, which attacks recur several times an hour or
day, or may be absent for days or months. An extended freedom from all pain
is rare in a patient very much affected. The first attacks in all forms of
neuralgia are often comparatively light, and the severity of the pain
gradually increases as the attacks multiply. We have frequently had
patients unacquainted with anatomy, map out the distribution of a nerve
very perfectly, simply describing the portion of the body in which the pain
was experienced. For convenience, the neuralgia has been named with
reference to the nerve most seriously attacked; lumbago to the spasms of
pain affecting the small of the back; tic-douloureux is a term applied to
neuralgia of the fifth nerve, that supplying the side of the face, with
branches to the eyes, jaw, and teeth. Neuralgia of the testicles, ovaries,
stomach, heart, are frequently met with. That affecting the large nerve
supplying the thigh and leg is termed sciatica. These nerve affections
often prove a most grave disorder, rendering the life of the sufferer a
burden.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. Contrary to opinions frequently expressed by members
of the medical profession, we find that most cases present some removable,
or remediable, cause for attacks of headache and neuralgia. The temporary
relief that is obtained by the use of "headache powders," various bromide
combinations, caffeine and other anodyne and narcotic medicines, is
sometimes necessary in order that the excruciating sufferings may be borne
for the time, but as a rule such remedies only react unfavorably by
interfering still further with the natural restoration of the affected
organs, or protract the removal of the cause of the disease. Hence, the
next attack is usually earlier in its appearance and more severe and
lasting when such agents are employed.</p>

<p>The great majority of headaches and neuralgias are due to the presence
of poisons in the blood. This may be due to affections of the blood-making,
or blood-purifying organs.</p>

<p>For the correction of inactive blood-making glands, or a lack of
purification of the blood, due to such cause, the use of Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery is particularly beneficial. It has no equal in its
direct effect upon the liver, the great purifying organ of the body.
Through this natural gateway, it removes from the system poisonous
materials which are the waste from the nerve cells. The accumulation of
these waste materials irritates the cells and causes them to cry out with
pain. The blood, being properly purified by the use of "Golden Medical
Discovery" supplies to the nerves, and to the nerve cells, what they
crave&mdash;a healthy and rich blood that furnishes <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_637" id="Page_637"></a>[pg 637]</span>proper nourishment. Hence
the headache disappears, and the neuralgic pains are overcome.</p>

<p>When the liver is engorged and torpid, the intestines become overloaded
with fecal matters that putrefy and give rise to gases and consequent
distention. Deleterious poisons are formed and absorbed by the blood from
such hardened and irritating lumps in the intestines. When the bowels are
thus constipated, Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets are necessary as an adjunct
to the "Golden Medical Discovery." The "Pellets" remove from the intestinal
canal all irritating materials and thus enhance the alterative, or
blood-cleansing, action of the "Golden Medical Discovery."</p>

<p>In women, when there is a nervous affection, dependent upon some
unnatural state of the ovaries or uterus, and complicated with an imperfect
or unnatural circulation in those parts, we have noted that most
satisfactory results invariably follow the use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription. This agent improves the tone of the nervous system, and by
its direct restorative tonic effects, lessens, or overcomes, any congestion
of the womb or its appendages, regulates menstruation and promotes a
condition of health and vigor.</p>

<p>In a vast experience, our specialists have thoroughly tested a great
many specific remedies which we prescribe for home-treatment, sending the
necessary remedies to our patients by express or mail, carefully adapting
them to each individual case. Many sufferers have been, by a brief course
of our home-treatment, relieved permanently from excruciating sufferings
that had been a source of annoyance and loss of time for many years prior
to the use of our remedies.</p>

<p>Our treatment is intended to effect permanent cures. We do not use those
narcotics and compounds of antipyrine and other similar agents which are
very depressing in their effects, and, like morphine and other preparations
of opium, give only temporary relief, and interfere with the action of the
heart, but we use treatment that builds up the system, removes the cause of
the difficulty and restores the nervous system and all the organs of the
body to a normal and healthful condition.</p>

<p>In some cases we advise treatment in our Institution, where we have
every facility in the way of electrical appliances and many other aids that
can only be employed by the personal attention of a skillful physician.
These aids are more fully described under the head of nervous exhaustion
and a reference is also suggested to what we have to say under the heads of
paralysis and locomotor ataxia.</p>

<p>Headaches or neuralgic pains, due to local irritations, as uterine
disease, stricture, neurotic or nerve tumors, pressure of trusses, eye
strain from weakened eye muscles, or lenses that need the help of proper
spectacles, require for a permanent cure the removal of the cause. Sciatic
neuralgia, one of the most common and painful forms of nerve irritation, is
particularly amenable to treatment by the modern means of cure used in our
practice at the Invalids' Hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638"></a>[pg
638]</span>We find, as a rule, that severe headaches and neuralgias are but
the forerunners of more serious conditions, and are therefore deserving of
special attention. They should be corrected as early as possible, before
any organic changes have occurred.</p>

<hr />



<h1>PARALYSIS OR PALSY;</h1> <h2>LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA AND KINDRED
AFFECTIONS.</h2>


<p>Paralysis is an affection characterized by loss of muscular power or by
the sense of touch, taste, sight or smell becoming impaired from injury to
a nerve by accident or disease.</p>

<p>The disease is sometimes due to simple lack of nerve force or power.
This may come from interference with the blood supply of the nerve centres,
as in hysterical palsy and reflex paralysis. Frequently the power of speech
is affected in this way, ability to remember and difficulty in
pronunciation of certain words being the most common. Certain affections of
the womb and its appendages, in women, and, in men, stricture of the
urethra, adherent prepuce, or foreskin, with wounds and injuries, many
times of nerves and organs remote from the paralyzed points, cause the loss
of power.</p>

<p><b>The Causes of Paralysis</b> are very numerous. Whatever destroys, or
impairs the natural structure of nervous matter, or whatever interferes
materially with the conducting power of nerve-fibre, or the generating
power of the nerve-centres, will produce a paralysis, the extent of which
will depend upon the amount of nervous matter affected. Thus paralysis may
be due to disease of the brain arising from apoplexy; to abscess,
softening, syphilitic or other tumors, or epilepsy; to disease of the
spinal cord, or marrow; to disease of the structures which surround the
spinal cord, producing pressure upon it; to injury or compression of a
nerve, by which its conducting power it impaired; to the effects of
diphtheria, hysteria, or rheumatism. It may also be due to poisoning of
nervous matter with opium, lead, arsenic, or mercury; or to the retention
of poisonous substances which are generated in the living body and which
should pass off through the excretory organs, as the elements of the urine
and bile.</p>

<p>Members of consumptive families are very prone to paralysis.</p>

<p>We also find that the disease is often the result of some nervous
strain, or over excitement The over indulgence of the passions is
particularly a fruitful source of injury to the brain and spinal centres.
An angry man or woman uses up more nerve energy in a few minutes than would
be sufficient to serve the muscles with stimulus through hours of toil.</p>

<p>The young, in unnatural indulgence of the sexual passions, waste the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639"></a>[pg
639]</span>vigor and energy of maturity. Sexual excesses must be put down
as among the most prolific causes of this terrible malady. Ignorance
shields no one from the consequences of violations of the laws of
health.</p>

<p>The passion for wealth with its ceaseless toil, continuous strain, and
rapid exhaustion of the nerve forces, usually brings its devotee into the
same condition of discord as does the abuse of a stimulant. For a time the
system will repair and bolster up the weakness, but the longer the day of
reckoning is postponed, the more serious and terrible is the collapse.</p>

<p>Such individuals need only an exposure to cold, or an over indulgence of
some kind, to suddenly precipitate a paralysis.</p>

<p><b>General Paralysis</b>. This term is applied to paralysis affecting
the arms and legs. In this form of paralysis there is generally more loss
of motion than of sensation, and the mind is usually more or less
affected.</p>

<p><b>Hemiplegia</b>, or paralysis of one side of the body, is generally
spoken of as a "stroke of palsy." Sometimes only one extremity, the arm, is
affected. Only occasionally is the face involved. In the majority of cases
the mind is affected, the memory being poor, the sufferer becoming
melancholy, peevish, and fretful.</p>

<p>In paralysis of the right side, there is sometimes a curious
forgetfulness or misplacement of language, the patient being unable to
think of words to express his thoughts. This condition is called
<i>aphasia</i>. It is usually the result of some injury or disease of the
brain, almost invariably the side of the brain opposite the affected half
of the body. In some cases it is due to a wasting, or softening, of the
brain substance, on account of insufficient nourishment, a deficient supply
of blood; whilst in others, it is due to just the opposite condition, an
excess of blood, producing rupture of some blood-vessel, transudations, and
pressure.</p>

<p><b>Paraplegia</b>, or paralysis of the lower half of the body, is the
result of disease of the spinal marrow. The paralysis may occur suddenly,
but, in the majority of cases, it comes on slowly and insidiously, with
weakness and numbness of the feet and legs, or with tingling and a
sensation resembling that produced by ants creeping on the surface of the
skin. By degrees the weakness increases, until there is complete loss of
both motion and sensation in the feet and legs. The lower bowel and bladder
are generally involved, and as a result, the patient suffers from
constipation, and retention and dribbling of urine. Although completely
paralyzed, the patient is often tormented with involuntary movements and
cramps in the affected muscles.</p>

<p>Paraplegia may be caused by various injuries of the spinal cord; by
congestion, degeneration, or hemorrhage; by pressure from thickening of the
sheath of the cord, or from tumors, or from disease of the bones and
cartilages of the spinal column. Paraplegia may also be produced through
reflex action, by an irritation, or injury to some organ or part <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640"></a>[pg 640]</span>of the
body distant from the spinal cord; thus, irritation of the skin, or of the
bowels from the presence of worms, or disease of the bladder or of the
womb, may produce paraplegia.</p>


<h3>LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA.</h3>

<p>Locomotor ataxia, or creeping palsy, is also called progressive
paralysis. This affection consists of a disease of the nervous matter in
the posterior columns of the spinal cord. It usually affects first the
lower part of the cord, and those portions of the nerve matter that supply
the muscles of the legs. In other cases it first affects the portions of
the spinal cord that supply the arms. In most cases of this disease there
is an early stage in which the patient suffers from "lightning pains," as
they are called. These are of a severe, stabbing, boring character, very
sudden in their onset, and at times so serious as to have induced suicide.
These paroxysms, in the milder form of the disease, are not so severe, and
are readily controlled by anodynes. They may affect the stomach, and be
mistaken for dyspepsia, or the rectum, and be taken for fissure or piles.
At times they affect the bladder, when the symptoms are not unlike those of
stone or cancer. In many cases we find the patient has been treated for a
long period of years for rheumatism, sciatica, or neuralgia, when the real
disease has been this progressive paralysis in its earlier stage. Sometimes
the disease takes the form of spermatorrhea or impotency; in other cases it
is manifested in weak eyes, disturbances of vision, or cross-eyes. Sooner
or later, there appears the peculiar paralysis of the disease, which
consists of more or less numbness of the feet and legs, and, in the later
stages, of the hands and arms, sometimes of the face. As a rule, however,
the patient finds difficulty in properly maintaining his balance, and in
walking his movements are tottering, like a man partially intoxicated. It
is difficult for him to maintain his balance and walk with his eyes closed.
If the arms are affected, their movements are uncertain. In guiding a
needle or in buttoning or unbuttoning the clothing, there is an inability
to move the hand with rapidity and certainty, or to any portion of the face
or body if the eyes be closed. The eyes and attention must be constantly
directed to the motion that is about to be performed, or it is imperfectly
done. The brain centres in this case supply the weakened action of the
spinal cord, and the stimulus to the muscles is directed by the
intelligence instead of being automatic, as in health, and due to spinal
action. Still later, the voluntary movements become spasmodic or jerking.
The neuralgic pains often become very distressing; there is often a sense
of constriction around the limbs or body, as if they were encircled with
tight cords. In extreme cases locomotion becomes impossible, the patient is
unable to bring the hand to the mouth, and the speech may become impaired,
articulation being difficult and imperfect. In all cases there is more or
less loss of sensation in the lower limbs, the patient generally being
usable to distinguish between two points and one, even when the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641"></a>[pg 641]</span>two,
are a considerable distance apart. The inability to feel the contact of the
ground or floor with the feet occasions the difficulty in walking. <b>The
causes</b> of this disease are somewhat obscure, but unquestionably
exposure to cold and dampness, and over-mental work, are largely
instrumental in its production. Scrofula and syphilis favor its
development, while abuse of the nervous system, such as results from
over-indulgence of the animal and reproductive instincts, are frequent
sources of the nervous changes that lead to ataxia.</p>


<h3>SHAKING PALSY.</h3>

<p><i>Shaking Palsy, or Paralysis Agitans</i>, is an affection dependent
upon degenerative changes in the nervous centres. It is characterized by a
tremulous agitation, or continual shaking, beginning in the hands, arms or
head, and gradually extending itself over the entire body. The disease
progresses slowly, but when far advanced the agitation is violent, and the
patient swallows and masticates his food with great difficulty. In an
advanced stage of the disease, the body becomes bent forward, and the chin
almost touches the breast-bone. The tremor, which early in the disease only
occurred during the time the patient was awake, now continues during sleep,
and not infrequently the agitation becomes so violent as to waken the
sufferer.</p>


<h3>GENERAL TREATMENT OF PARALYSIS.</h3>

<p>The indications of treatment for the various forms of paralysis are to
remove the causes, if these can be determined, and rouse the functions of
the paralyzed parts. Measures should be adopted to remedy the morbid
conditions upon which this affection depends. Keep the skin clean and
healthy, promote the circulation of the blood, especially in the paralyzed
limbs, and encourage healthy nutrition. These ends may be best attained by
the daily employment of stimulating baths and frictions upon the surface.
As much regular exercise as the patient can bear without fatigue should be
taken in order to favor the preservation of the appetite and strength. Care
should also be taken that the bowels are evacuated regularly every day. The
circulation through, and consequently the nutrition of, the palsied muscles
may be aided by having a strong healthy person knead and manipulate them.
These manual movements upon the surface of the body will often excite
muscular sensibility, similar to that awakened by a weak Faradic current.
The internal medicines should be such as to regulate the general functions
of the system. The use of these remedies must be directed by the skill and
experience of those who are professionally qualified to administer hem.</p>

<p>When the patient has been able to be under our personal care at the
Invalids' Hotel, we have found the employment of mechanical movements and
manipulations, applied by means of a variety of machinery, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642"></a>[pg
642]</span>employed in this Institution, together with the use of the
equalizer, or large dry cupping, or vacuum apparatus, to be of the greatest
benefit. These several machines and apparatus furnish a perfect system of
physical training, thus rendering valuable aid in the cure of many forms of
obstinate chronic diseases. A few of these machines are shown in Figs. 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, and 14; also see page 32 of Appendix.</p>

10. Manipulator Folded.</p>

<p>The general practitioner often endeavors to overcome the inertia of the
nerve-centers and nerves by means of specific irritants, with the view of
exciting the power-producing function, of compelling the weakened and
disabled centers to evolve more power. By such stimulation and forcing, he
places a burden on the weakest parts. The compulsory and ineffectual
endeavor of the weak parts to act in response to such stimulation is very
liable to make undue drafts upon the capacity to act, which only end in
exhaustion of the little remaining power instead of its re-enforcement.
Cases which were previously curable by direct and appropriate means, are
thus forever placed beyond the reach of remedies. No powerful stimulating
or depressing medicines are indicated in any of the various forms of the
affection. In paralysis it should be our aim to improve local and general
nutrition, to relieve local congestions and inflammations, to produce
absorption of deposited matters, and to force an abundance of blood through
palsied muscles, from which they may derive a proper supply of nutriment,
and to which they may give up the products of waste. All this can be
accomplished by massage, mechanical movements, regulation of the
atmospheric pressure on the body, baths, and proper physical culture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643"></a>[pg
643]</span>In paralysis, there is a diminution or total loss of the
contractile property of the muscles to which the affected nerve fibers are
distributed; consequently the capillaries and small veins are not
compressed, as in health, and the blood is not forced on through them
towards the heart; hence there is a backing-up of the circulation, passive
congestion, and all the evils incident to that condition ensue.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise357"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 11. Oscillating the Arms and Chest." src="images/advise357.png"
/></a><br />Fig. 11. Oscillating the Arms and Chest.</p>

<p><i>Mechanical movements</i> properly applied to the affected limbs, or
parts of the body, accomplish the same results as contraction of the
muscles. They compress the capillaries and veins and thus force the blood
on through these vessels towards the heart. There is a constant pressure in
the arteries, hence the flow of blood in the capillaries is always towards
the veins, and, when it gets into the veins, it is prevented from flowing
back by the valves in those vessels.</p>

<p>A proper circulation of the blood through the disordered parts is thus
effected, and, as the result, they receive an abundance of nutriment, and
their waste products are promptly carried away to the excretory organs, by
which they are separated from the body; the deposits of fatty matter
between the muscular fibers are absorbed, and the agglutinated fibers are
separated.</p>



<p class="rfigure"><a name="advise358"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 12. Rubbing the Legs." src="images/advise358.png" /></a><br />Fig. 12.
Rubbing the Legs.</p>

<p>As proof of these statements, it has been found by experiment and
observation that there is an increase of temperature in the parts subjected
to this action, which <i>must</i> be due mainly to an increase in the
chemico-vital changes that are superinduced by the nutritious elements of
the arterial blood, particularly that element which is supplied to it by
the inspired air, oxygen. All the products of waste are increased. The skin
becomes more soft and moist, showing that the amount of matter eliminated
by it is increased. The urine becomes more abundant, and the relative
amount of urea, its most important constituent, becomes greatly increased.
The amount of carbonic acid gas exhaled is increased, and further evidence
in the same direction is furnished by <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_644" id="Page_644"></a>[pg 644]</span>the very marked increase
in the inspiratory acts, necessitated by the increased demands for
oxygen.</p>



<p class="lfigure"><a name="advise359"><img width="90%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 13. Oscillating the Legs." src="images/advise359.png" /></a><br />Fig.
13. Oscillating the Legs.</p>

<p>The local increase of the circulation incident to properly applied
mechanical movements, must produce a corresponding diminution of blood in
other, even in remote, regions of the body. Thus this treatment, by its
revulsive effects, is capable of relieving various disorders of the head,
chest, digestive organs, and pelvis. Nowhere, however, is the effect more
satisfactory than in affections of the brain and spinal cord, whether
characterized by loss of power, of sensation, or by neuralgic pain. Any
portion of these nerve centres suffering from congestion, will find prompt
relief in mechanical vibratory movements.</p>

<p><b>The Movement Cure</b> which we advocate is not a "Swedish Movement
Cure," nor anything akin to it. It is the application of remedial forces by
complex structures, which combine a variety of mechanical powers. The
inventions are solely American.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="advise360"><img width="40%" alt="Illustration:
Fig. 14. Apparatus for Rubbing in a Recumbent Position."
src="images/advise360.png" /></a><br />Fig. 14. Apparatus for Rubbing in a
Recumbent Position.</p>

<p>By means of this machinery, which is driven by steam power with great
velocity, we are able to apply <i>soft, pleasant, rapid vibrating
movements</i> over the surface of the body, and thereby increase the
circulation of blood through the parts, raise the temperature, and excite
pleasant sensations. The movements can be applied by our
ingeniously-devised machinery to any part of the body through the clothing
and <i>without the least exposure of the person.</i> They can be
administered in a great variety of ways, by light, quiet persuasions, by
gentle frictions, by rubbing, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645"
id="Page_645"></a>[pg 645]</span>by oscillations, by kneadings, by circular
movements, in fact, by an almost <i>endless variety</i> of reciprocating
and alternating motions, which, if described, would convey to the mind of
the reader but a faint conception of their remedial value.</p>

<p><b>Vibratory Motion</b> not only establishes activity of the circulation
through the skin and muscles, but it also affects profoundly the
circulation in the important and vital organs of the body; it is thus
capable of overcoming torpidity or congestion of the liver, spleen, and
other deep-seated organs, without the depressing effects which sometimes
follow the administration of powerful medicines.</p>

<p>It has not been our purpose to literally explain, in detail, the methods
of applying vibratory motion in the treatment of paralysis for popular
experiment, since to be successful one should become an expert, not only in
this mechanical treatment, but also in the diagnosis of the various forms
of paralysis, as well as familiar with their causes, pathology, and
remedial requirements. Thus, to be successful in the treatment of paralysis
and other nervous diseases, by the application of motor forces with our
ingeniously-contrived machinery, the cost of which is beyond the means of
most invalids, one must exercise great discretion.</p>

<p><b>Gratifying Success.</b> Not only is vibratory motion as a remedial
agent rational and philosophical, but our experience has fully demonstrated
its marvelous effects in the treatment of paralysis in its various forms,
and also in the cure of other chronic diseases. We have cured cases of
infantile paralysis which had resisted the skill of the most renowned
physicians in our country. We have treated those who could not stand or
bear the weight of the body, but who have been so far restored as to be
able to walk and run without assistance. Writer's and telegraph operator's
paralysis, or cramp, we have cured in a few weeks' time. Club-feet, spinal
curvature, and other deformities resulting from paralysis, have been
successfully treated in our Institution. In short, our success has been
most flattering in all curable cases of paralysis, and it is such
experience that induces us to hold out encouragement to those who are
afflicted with paralysis and other nervous affections.</p>

<p>Vibratory motion is a desideratum of priceless value to those who are
afflicted with diseases of the nervous system, as well as to all others who
need a gentle stimulus to call forth their latent energies and improve
their physical condition.</p>


<h3>RECAPITULATION.</h3>

<p>Motion, properly transmitted to the human system by mechanical
apparatus, is transformed into other forms of force identical with vital
energy, by which the ordinary processes of the system are greatly
promoted.</p>

<p>It increases animal heat and nervous and muscular power to the normal
standard.</p>

<p>It removes engorgement or local impediments to the circulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646"></a>[pg
646]</span>The electrical induction produced, renders it a most efficacious
remedy for paralysis of all kinds.</p>

<p>It removes interstitial fluids and causes rapid absorption and
disappearance of solid and fluid accumulations.</p>

<p>It is a powerful alterative, or blood-purifier, increasing oxidation and
stimulating excretion.</p>

<p>It diminishes chronic nervous irritability and promotes sleep.</p>

<p>It hardens the flesh by increasing muscular development and improves
digestion and nutrition.</p>


<h3>ANIMAL JUICES, OR EXTRACTS.</h3>

<p>The use of animal, nerve and gland extracts has proven of surprising
efficiency in the treatment of paralysis and locomotor ataxia. They furnish
a pabulum in concentrated form for the nourishment and restoration of the
weakened nerve cells and fibres.</p>

<p>In the vast majority of cases, we have been able, by the use of these
recently discovered curative agents, when assisted by other means at our
command at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, to arrest the
progress of these nervous affections, hitherto so generally considered
incurable, and bring about restoration of the paralysed functions and a
renewal of lost power.</p>

<p>These comparatively new remedial agents have been very thoroughly tested
by us. Their merits are more fully considered in a preceding chapter of
this treatise, under the head of treatment for Nervous Exhaustion, or
Debility.</p>

<h1>EPILEPSY ("FITS").</h1>


<p>Epilepsy, or falling sickness, is a disease which is characterized by
attacks of sudden loss of consciousness, together with convulsive
movements of the muscles. The paroxysms occur at irregular intervals, the
periods between them, in some cases, being only a few minutes or hours,
while in others, several months elapse.</p>

<p>There are two classes of Epilepsy: 1st. The general form, with a
convulsion that usually involves all the muscles of the body
simultaneously. It begins suddenly with little or no warning, commonly with
a cry or scream. The convulsion may last several minutes and is followed by
a deep sleep for some hours.</p>

<p>2nd. The local or Jacksonian form in which the attack begins with a
peculiar sensation in some particular region of the body, either in one
extremity or one half of the face. This sensation is followed by a
twitching of the muscles of the part. The sensation and spasm extend or
advance gradually to other parts. Consciousness is not usually lost, though
it may be when the spasms culminate in a general convulsion.</p>

<p>Great weakness generally follows in the parts convulsed, gradually
passing away. When the attack begins on the right side of the face it is
associated with an immediate inability to speak.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. In the severe forms of the disease, the subject
suddenly loses consciousness and falls; there is rigidity of the muscles,
which causes a twitching of the face and limbs; the eyes are turned up, and
there is foaming at the mouth. In the severe form of the disease, the
respiration is arrested, while in the milder attacks, the breathing is
difficult, slow, deep, and snoring. With the commencement of the spasm, the
tongue is sometimes caught between the teeth and severely bitten. During
the paroxysm, the countenance changes from a livid hue to dark purple. The
convulsion continues from one to three minutes, and is followed by a deep,
sighing inspiration; the subject then sinks into a deep sleep, which
continues for half an hour or longer. When consciousness is first regained,
the subject appears confused, stupid, and usually complains of headache. He
has no recollection of what has occurred during the attack, he pronounces
words indistinctly, and if he attempts to walk, he staggers like a drunken
man. Sometimes, several attacks occur so closely together that there is no
interval of consciousness between them.</p>

<p>In some cases, there are premonitory symptoms, such as giddiness,
drowsiness, headache, and irritability of temper, which warn the subject of
an approaching paroxysm. Occasionally, a wave of cold commencing at the
feet and proceeding to the head, is experienced. This is called an
<i>aura</i>. When it reaches the brain, the subject becomes <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648"></a>[pg
648]</span>unconscious, falls, and the convulsion commences. If the disease
be allowed to proceed unchecked, it almost invariably leads to great
impairment of mind, insanity, or paralysis.</p>

<p><b>Causes</b>. The <i>predisposing causes</i> are an hereditary tendency
to the disease, and everything which impairs the constitution and produces
nervous prostration and irritability. Syphilis, phimosis, sexual abuses,
uterine disease, and the use of alcoholic liquors are prominent
predisposing causes. Many of the causes treated by us have been brought on
by masturbation. Others are the results of injury to the head. Often
fracture of the skull is followed by epileptic attacks.</p>

<p><i>The exciting causes</i> include everything which disturbs the
equilibrium of the nervous system. Indigestible articles of food,
intestinal worms, loss of sleep, great exhaustion, grief, anger,
constipation of the bowels, piles, and uterine irritation may be enumerated
among such causes. Convulsions of an epileptic character may also be
induced by a poisoned condition of the blood, from malaria and disease of
the kidneys or liver.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. When the time of an expected paroxysm approaches,
great care should be exercised that the patient be not suddenly attacked
while carrying a lighted lamp, or that he does not fall in some dangerous
place, strike upon a heated stove, or in some similar way inflict great
injury. If there be warning symptoms before the attack, the subject should
carry a vial of the <i>nitrite of amyl</i> in the pocket, and, when the
premonitory symptoms are felt, two or three drops should be poured on a
handkerchief and held about an inch from the nose and inhaled, until
flushing is produced, or a burning sensation is felt in the face.</p>

<p>During the paroxysm, the subject should be laid on the back, with the
head slightly elevated, and the clothing about the neck and waist, if
tight, should be loosened. If there be sufficient warning, a folded napkin,
or a soft pine stick covered with a handkerchief or cloth, should be placed
between the double teeth, to prevent the tongue from being bitten. During
the fit, the head may be bathed with cold water.</p>

<p>A person who suffers from this disease should avoid everything which
tends to excite the nervous system, or increase to any great extent the
action of the heart. The sufferer should go to bed at regular hours, and
take at least eight hours sleep. The sleeping-room should be large and well
ventilated, and the patient should lie with the head elevated. All
indigestible articles of food should be avoided and the diet should consist
principally of bread, vegetables, milk, and fruits. Meat should be taken
but once a day, and then in very small quantities. The use of alcoholic
liquors and coffee should be avoided, and tea only taken in small
quantities. The bowels should be regulated with Dr. Pierce's Pleasant
Pellets and injections, if necessary. A thorough bath should be taken once
or twice a week. If the attacks occur at night, the body should be sponged
before going to bed with tepid <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649"
id="Page_649"></a>[pg 649]</span>water, to which should be added sufficient
tincture or infusion of capsicum, or red-pepper, to render it stimulating
to the skin.</p>

<p>The causes, if they can be determined, should be removed, and those
remedies administered which relieve nervous irritability and cerebral
congestion. If due to worms, the proper remedies should be given; if to
phimosis, the subject should be circumcised; if to pressure on the brain,
from fracture of the skull, trephining should be practiced, and the
depressed bone raised. There are no <i>specifics</i> for this disease; each
individual case must be treated according to the condition presented. The
nostrums advertised extensively over the country as specifics for this
disease, while they may, in some instances, prevent the attacks for a short
time, irritate the stomach, impair digestion, lower vitality, and
permanently injure the system, often rendering the disease incurable. They
deceive the sufferer, leading him to think that his disease is being cured,
until it progresses so far that he is beyond the reach of any treatment. As
a rule, the longer the disease progresses, the more difficult it is to
cure.</p>

<p>Epilepsy has by many physicians been regarded as incurable, but our
extensive experience has convinced us that by an appropriate course of
treatment, the <i>vast majority</i> of cases can be cured. The animal
extracts, or juices, herein more fully described under the head of
treatment for Nervous Exhaustion, have proven curative in some cases that
have resisted other remedies. This treatment requires the personal
attention of a physician skilled in its employment. It is also of first
importance that the extracts be properly made. We have discovered several
new remedies, which undoubtedly exert a powerful curative influence over
this disease, but it is necessary to vary the treatment so much in
different cases, that it would be useless to enter further into details in
this treatise.</p>

<p><b>Surgical Treatment</b>. A considerable proportion of those cases of
epilepsy, termed Jacksonian, have been found to be caused by new growth
upon, or in, the substance of the brain. Sometimes cysts form as a result
of small hemorrhages, or of spots of softening from clots in the cerebral
arteries. Other cases are due to a small spot of hardened tissue or an
inflamed centre of irritation in the outer gray matter of the brain.</p>

<p>The majority of these forms of disease can be exactly localized in a
small area of the brain, and may usually be traced to a blow or fall on the
head, or to fracture of the skull without depression. The discovery of the
fact that such results of injury will produce localized spasm has naturally
lead to the conclusion that similar products anywhere in the brain may give
rise to epilepsy. In these cases trephining of the skull and the removal of
irritation from the brain has been followed by the most successful results.
It is seldom a serious or dangerous operation, but very few deaths having
resulted in the practice of good surgeons in many hundreds of cases, and
these were individuals <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650"
id="Page_650"></a>[pg 650]</span>who were not favorable for operation, and
in whom it was undertaken as a last resort.</p>

<p>In these cases of epilepsy, due to injury, the operation is fairly safe,
and in carefully selected cases that have not been allowed to run so long
as to bring upon the brain a general epileptic tendency, the results of
operation are good and the procedure warrantable.</p>

<h1>CHOREA (ST. VITUS'S DANCE).</h1>


<p>This disease is an affection of the nervous system, which is
characterized by spasmodic contractions of certain muscles. It may affect
the entire body, although it is usually confined to the left side, or to a
special group of muscles.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>. Twitchings of the muscles of the face are the most
conspicuous symptoms. They are at first comparatively slight, but as the
disease progresses, these spasms become more decided, and the face is
twisted into various shapes and forms. The head, in some cases, is
constantly jerking. It is with great difficulty that the tongue is thrust
out of the mouth, and then, with a sudden jerk, it is quickly
withdrawn.</p>

<p>These spasms or contortions, may affect the extremities in a similar
manner, the hands and arms cannot be kept quiet, the gait may be unsteady,
and one foot is merely dragged after the other. If one limb be forcibly
held, to keep it quiet, some other limb will involuntarily move. Strange as
it may appear, these contractions, which cannot be controlled by the will
during wakefulness, are very much lessened or arrested by sleep.</p>

<p>Prior to the development of the spasmodic affection, there is usually a
period in which the sufferer notes a want of appetite, languidness, with
disinclination towards mental or bodily pursuits, headache, restlessness,
pains in the limbs and joints, with irritable temper and weakness of
memory. There are many other symptoms in special cases. As the disease
develops, the patient gradually begins to exhibit an awkwardness of
movement in the extremities, and objects frequently fall from the grasp.
Children thus afflicted, spill their food while eating, and it becomes
difficult for them to stand still. Attempts to write, sew, or draw are
imperfectly performed. Such children are very often punished for supposed
ill-behavior or careless habits. Later on the symptoms become more
unmistakable, and the presence of the disease is readily recognized. The
patient may become incapable of dressing, and the limbs and face are no
longer under the control of the will. Uncontrollable movements of the
fingers, hands, shrugging of the shoulders, dancing of the legs, grimaces
of the face, and distortions of the body, become more or less constant.
Speech and swallowing may be seriously embarrassed. Any unusual excitement
of the mind or <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651"
id="Page_651"></a>[pg 651]</span>body is apt to intensify the muscular
twitchings. Severe mental application, the reading of exciting books, the
witnessing of entertainments, and excessive indulgence in sports, have to
be discontinued.</p>

<p><b>The most common causes</b> seem to be exhaustion of the nerve
centres, due to the appearance of the second teeth in children and the
development common to the age of puberty. Other causes may be briefly
mentioned as follows: rheumatic affections, constipation, a morbid state of
the blood, suppression of the menstrual function, uterine difficulties,
masturbation, or self-abuse, blows, injuries, or any cause which would give
rise to nervous debility. Sometimes it is caused by obstruction in the
alimentary canal, or by intestinal worms.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>. The disease is one in which there is a debility of the
nerve centres, complicated with a lack of assimilation and digestion. There
is no affection more amenable to treatment in its early stages than this.
We are daily in receipt of correspondence from sufferers, or their parents,
or friends, in which the most gratifying relief and a cure has resulted
from the use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription used in conjunction with
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. These two remedies should be used
alternately, the dose being suited to the age of the patient.</p>

<p>A large majority of the cases of chorea occur in females and at the
period of life when the nervous system is subjected to unusual
requirements. In these cases the "Favorite Prescription" effects a gradual
restoration of nervous energy, and improvement in the tone of the nerve
centres, and by its direct effect upon the circulation in the ovarian
region, eliminates the most potent causes of debility. In young people, we
usually advise a dose of three drops for each year of the age. For
instance, children of eight years of age should take twenty-four drops;
those of twelve, thirty-six drops; those of fifteen, forty-five drops,
which is about two-thirds of a teaspoonful. A similar dose of Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery should be administered, taking it before meals,
and the "Prescription" after meals. Under their administration the patient
will rapidly improve in health and strength; the circulation is materially
bettered, the blood is purified, enriched, vitalized. The remedies effect a
complete removal, from the blood, of the impurities that represent nerve
waste, and as a consequence the nerve cells are properly nourished. The
disease is gradually controlled, and when the favorable influences of
quiet, nourishing food, with plenty of outdoor air, and not too active
exercise is added, the progress is most gratifying. The patients, in a few
weeks, are able to control much of the spasmodic movements, and gradually
their restoration to a normal condition is accomplished.</p>

<p>In occasional cases, where there is some complication, as rheumatism or
other severe affection, complicating and preventing their recovery, special
treatment is required. We are always ready to advise in regard to such
cases when consulted either by mail or in person.</p>

a result of your few weeks' treatment, I feel better now in both body and
mind than I have for fifteen years. Before I consulted you I felt more like
taking my own life to end my miserable feelings than I felt like living; I

but, thank God, your encouragement, and kind words, and skillful treatment
have made a different man of me.</p>

<p>Before I consulted you, I took no interest in business nor any thing

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;For the last year and a half I was troubled with
Nervous Debility. I tried some medicine that I bought from the druggist,
which did me little or no good; so, hearing of the World's Dispensary
Medical Association, of Buffalo, I wrote them about my case, and in reply,
they said they were sure they could cure me. At that time I was weak in my
arms and legs, had poor sight and, worst of all, I was very nervous and
bashful. I could not sleep at night and feel refreshed in the morning. I
could not look any one in the eye without feeling ashamed.</p>

<p>I have now taken two months' treatment and I feel sound in mind and

will surely be cured. I cannot praise them too much for what they have done
for me.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I had been out of health for a period of about three
years. Suffered with pains in the head, catarrh, chills, fever,
nervousness, and general debility. Spent about all the money I had in order
to obtain relief, but received little, if any good. I was scarcely able to
work, when in July, 1887, I wrote to your Association, describing my case.
You replied, advising me, and prescribing a course of treatment, which you
sent to me. After taking but a part of these medicines I began to feel a
great deal better; could sleep very much better and was able to resume work
as usual, but still suffered some pain in head, and my buck was lame and
weak. I continued treatment for some three or four months, until all
remaining symptoms of distress and weakness had disappeared. At the end of
about eight months I found I felt as well as I ever did. My weight had
increased fully twenty pounds, and I could safely say that you had effected
a perfect cure in my case.</p>

Favorite Prescription, I began to get better; could sleep well nights, and
that bad nervous feeling and the pain in my back soon left me. I can walk
several miles without getting tired. I took in all, three bottles of the

when at work. I could hardly get up in the morning; it seemed as if I were
more tired then I was when I went to bed. My appetite at times was
ravenous, and at other times the smell of food made me sick; I would often
go from the dinner table and vomit. I would have spells when it seemed that
every man was my foe and would be melancholy, and think that something was
going to happen to me; was easily upset, could not get my mind to stay on
anything long at a time. When I read about your remedies, I made up my mind
to try them. After taking one month's treatment I felt better, and kept on
until I had taken three months' treatment and was made a new man. I would

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I commenced treatment, I think, in July or August, of
1888, and continued four months. My case was nervous debility of fifteen
years' standing.</p>

<p>I tried home doctors but found they were only aggravating my case. I
also tried the Remedy Company, then of St. Louis, who claimed to perform
wonderful cures with their "Pastiles," but they proved utterly worthless.
Having come in possession of Dr. Pierce's little book and circulars, a
perusal of the same convinced me that my health would not be trifled with
at his Institution.</p>

<p>I was a poor man and could not afford much experimenting. I ordered one
month's treatment, and at the end of this first month, I found, to my
surprise, that I was feeling different. The second month, still more
surprised at my returning health. Third month thought I was cured, and
engaged myself to a young lady, and wrote you to that effect, and you
advised me with your congratulations to marry, and to order another month's
treatment; and at the end of the fourth month I was a <i>man</i>, something
I did not know what it would be like to be before.</p>

<p>I have now been married five years, and have two healthy children&mdash;a boy
and a girl. I would never have dared to marry had it not been for your
medicines. I must add that during this treatment I was troubled with
varicocele on left side. I wrote you this at third month of treatment, and
you sent without extra charge, a Suspensory and Lotion, and two months'
treatment cured me sound and well of this distressing malady; I have not
felt the least symptoms of its return.</p>

<p>I want the world to know what a competent and honorable firm the World's
Dispensary Medical Association is. I would love to shake you by the hand.
May God let you continue to be a help to mankind is my prayer.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I can bear testimony to the removal of varicocele, for
which you treated me. I had been in the habit of getting out with the boys
and trying to see which could kick the highest with one foot on the ground,
and it caused me to have varicocele. I went to my home doctor and he
treated me with no success. It was getting worse all the time and I got out
of shape all over. My health got bad and I thought my case hopeless. I had
tried two doctors and received no benefit.</p>

<p>I had one of your little Memorandum Books in my pocket, and one day,
looking through it I saw you treated such cases, and wrote you and received
word in a few days that you would treat me, so I sent off for one month's
treatment; and in five months I had gained my weight back, and that was
eight years ago and I feel sound and well and my health has been good ever
since.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I take pleasure in saying that the Invalids' Hotel is
the best institution in the world for the cure and treatment of all kinds
of chronic diseases. I was afflicted for a long time before I went to your
Institution for treatment, and I tried many doctors, but without avail.
After being in your Institution two months, I was restored to health, and I
am a well man to-day, and take pleasure in giving you many thanks. My
difficulty was the result of injury received early in life, and it has been
permanently and perfectly cured. With many good wishes and highest
recommendations.</p>

consider them good. Three years ago, I was much run-down with indigestion
and nervous prostration. I purchased about four bottles of "Golden Medical
Discovery" and "Favorite Prescription," and after taking them along with
the "Pellets", I felt much improved. Indeed, my friends told me I looked
like another woman.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I take greatest pleasure in making public the most
wonderful cure I received at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute of
Buffalo.</p>

<p>I had suffered severely for eight years with a left inguinal hernia; had
tried many physicians and medicines, but found only temporary relief. I was
greatly run-down, and my nervous system considerably shattered. My friends
persuaded me to go to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute. While
there I was operated on by their specialist, and in a few weeks began to
gain strength and energy so that I could return home, and have since felt
entirely well.</p>

<p>Words could not do justice to my feeling in regard to this institution.
There is no place like it for medical aid, and I would urge all invalids to
go there, feeling confident that they could no where receive more skillful
treatment or more kind attention and care.</p>

<p><i>Dear Sirs</i>&mdash;It is now over two years since I first began to feel
something the matter with me. I gradually got worse, with a nervous and
despondent feeling. I went to a doctor, who said I was suffering from
debility and ordered me away. I got a little better and returned to work,
but only to get worse again. I then had very restless nights with terrible
dreams, and would wake up all in a perspiration. I often wished I was dead.
At last, I had to give up work again, and thought that I should never
return to it. I was then under several doctors, but they did me no good. I
then came across a little book from your Association, and seeing cases like
mine cured, I determined to come to London and see you. I was then under
your treatment for three months at my home, taking your medicines and
adhering to your rules. I felt a change the first week, and after three
months' treatment I was restored to health. It is now four months since I
took any of your medicine, and have not had any symptoms return. I am now
at work again, and enjoying life the same as anyone else. I thank you very
much for your kind attention. I remain,</p>

constitutional disease, or combination of diseases, which rendered life

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;It is with pleasure that I add my testimony to your
list, hoping it may contribute to your success and induce others to avail
themselves of the benefit of your invaluable medicines. In June, 1890, I
took typhoid fever of malignant type; for two months I hovered between life
and death; at length the fever left me in a prostrated condition. Then I
was taken with a severe pain in my back and general nervous prostration;
could not move myself in bed nor bear to be moved by the most careful
nurses without experiencing excruciating pain. I had the best medical
attention in the community, but they failed to give relief. My friends
wrote to Dr. Pierce, stating my condition and requesting treatment for me.
He treated me for two months; by that time I had so much improved that I
did not think it worth while to continue the treatment longer, and my
health has been such that I have not had occasion to lie in bed two days
together since. I feel under lasting obligations to Dr. Pierce, and thank
God for blessing the world with so able a physician.</p>

<p>One day I saw an advertisement in a newspaper, about "If you are run
down and losing flesh, use 'Golden Medical Discovery.'" I, like a drowning
man, would grab at anything on sight. So I went to my druggist and asked
him for "Golden Medical Discovery," and he had it and I bought one bottle
and followed the directions and it did me good at first start; so I bought
two bottles every month until I had used about six bottles, then I had my
strength back and could draw my breath and felt like a new man.</p>

tell it all in a few words <i>I was all run down</i>. I had never wholly
recovered from the grip, which left me in a very poor condition; and that,
together with over-work and insufficient physical exercise, had put me in

had just gotten rid of an attack of bilious fever, which left me in a

was out felt better than I had for years, and now have no indication of a

great benefit I have received from your medicines and self-treatment at
home, which you kindly sent me, advising me to take your Dr. Pierce's
Favorite Prescription and "Pleasant Pellets" and "Golden Medical Discovery"
for my troubles. I did take your advice as near as I could; when I wrote my
first letter to you, I had been treated by different doctors for twelve
months and received but very little or no benefit, but had spent one
hundred dollars for treatment and medicines.</p>

<p>My husband, and little boy twelve years old, did all the family sewing
and washing and work in general, and I could not walk across the room
without help or stand on my feet one minute at a time; at night I could not
sleep, nor day time either; nothing I ate tasted well&mdash;I had no desire to
eat anything; my bowels were costive all the time, and after following your
advice and using about fourteen dollars worth of your medicines altogether,
I now feel like a new person. I am not bothered with that nervousness,
where it used to be that I could not stand a sudden rush of horses feet, or
a quick halloo from one's boys, or a sudden sound of anything would cause
me to take sudden nervous spells of some kind, as if I were smothering or
dying, or something of the kind&mdash;I can't tell just how I did feel. Now I do
all my washing, sewing and house work in general for a family of
seven&mdash;five children, my husband and self, and help my husband in the field
some besides. I can truthfully say, ii it had not been for Dr. Pierce's
medicines and the kind advice to me, with self-treatment at home, I would
have been dead long ago, and I never can feel that I can say enough for his
skill and medicine nor thank him enough for the good he has done me.</p>

<p>I use no other medicines in my family but these and never will, for they
do all that is claimed for them and more too. I have one of the "Advisers,"

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;In January of '90 I took the "grippe," went to work
before I was well, was caught in a rain which gave me a very bad relapse,
resulting in lung fever and complete prostration; was on my bed two months,
and when I did get out, the strength to walk any more than just a few rods
did not come back. My family doctor and two prominent physicians of Sioux
City, did me no good. Late in the fall I got a bottle of Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery, which quieted my trembling nerves and gave me an
appetite to eat. I then concluded to try the Doctor, personally. Up to this
time I was in a pitiable condition. Sometimes I could not sleep until I
felt almost wild, then sleep so much I would be stupefied. I could not
digest any food and my whole system was wasting and failing fast. I doubt
if any one who saw me expected me to get well. I took the treatment sent me
by the World's Dispensary Medical Association for more than a year. The
medicine never gave me any distress as other medicines had done before. I
began to improve from the start, but the change from one extreme to the
other was like the growth of a child.</p>

<p>To any one suffering from nervous prostration I would say, "don't be
impatient." It takes a long time for weakened nerves to grow strong. I have
at last become strong and well, thanks to the Giver of all good and the
grand Institution at Buffalo. I have since married a noble-hearted young
woman, and when I am playing with our sweet, healthy, baby girl, I give way
to the thought that at last the long, sad chapter of my life is ended; at
such times her merry laugh sounds like a song of triumph of life over
death.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;Six years ago I had an attack of measles, which left
my health in a precarious condition. I was placed under the treatment of a
good physician who did all in his power to restore my health, but all in
vain. I had dyspepsia and could not eat meat, vegetables nor fruit of any
kind. I suffered alternately from cold and heat. At times my feet and knees
would feel like ice to the touch, and at other times I would suffer the
most excruciating torture, seeming as though every nerve in my body was
being seared with a hot iron. My left hip and knee would become so affected
that I could scarcely walk across the room. I slept very little. On one
occasion I remained awake four days and four nights, and then was put to
sleep by repeated doses of morphine. My nervous system became so shattered
that words spoken by any person in my room fell like pebbles on my brain;
and nights I would often have to be raised in bed to prevent smothering to
death. It is impossible for me to describe my sufferings at that time but I
know that if it had not been for Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription I would
to-day have been in my grave.</p>

<p>I began the use of the "Favorite Prescription" in March&mdash;three years
ago, as well as I can remember. Continued till summer when I wrote to
you&mdash;received your advice and a few simple prescriptions which I had filled
at the drug store. I also began the use of the "Golden Medical Discovery."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673"></a>[pg
673]</span>My nerves became quiet: I slept well; my stomach began to heal;
my strength returned and I began to feel like a new person. And, to-day,
while I am not as strong as the strongest, I can do any kind of work that
other women do, and each season I can say I am stronger than I was the
last. I used thirty bottles of your medicines. Some may say that was a
great deal, but I will never regret the money and patience it took to cure
me. It has enabled me to once more enter school where I am trying to make
up for those lost years of my life, and as I join the girls in their romps,
I can say that "life is now sweet."</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;I am happy to say that your valuable medicine has been
a great benefit to me. I was suffering from general debility, malaria and
nervous sick headaches, and after my third child was born (a beautiful baby
boy of ten pounds) I only recovered after a long illness; I barely gained
strength enough in two years time so that I was able to crawl about to
accomplish the little housework that I had, by lying down to read many
times each day; had sick headaches very often; and many pains and aches,
all the time complaining of getting no better. I finally asked my husband
to get a bottle of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, which he promptly
did. After I had taken one bottle I could see a great change in my
strength, and fewer sick headaches.</p>

<p>I continued taking the medicine until I had taken eight bottles&mdash;seven
of the "Favorite Prescription" and one of the "Golden Medical Discovery."
For some time past I have not used it, but I am now able to do the
housework for myself, husband and two children (aged nine and five years).
I also take in dressmaking, and enjoy walking a mile at a time, and I think
it Is all due to the medicine, for I know I was only failing fast before I
commenced to take it. I take great pleasure in recommending the "Favorite
Prescription" to all women who suffer from debility and sick headache.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;In the latter part of 1890, I was struck down with
that terrible&mdash;and by many members of the medical profession pronounced to
be, incurable disease, locomotor ataxia. My family doctor declared that
nothing could be done for me, but for the sake of satisfaction advised me
to go to London, and see an expert, whom he named. I did so, with the
result of being told as above. This was in November, 1890. The symptoms
were first numbness in hands and feet, which soon extended as far as the
thighs, joined with the most intense feeling of cold that it can be
possible to imagine. For six months I felt as though I had stood in ice up
to my thighs. I soon became unable to walk or to stand, and crawled up
stairs on my hands and knees, I thought for the last time, as I then
thought I should die. Stomach troubles then set in, and for more than three
months, I endured the utmost agony. Night and day sweats absorbed my little
remaining strength, and I became helpless. I had taken leave of my family,
not expecting to last the day out, when I was seen by a young doctor, who
is fast becoming an eminent man, who said he thought he could alleviate my
sufferings&mdash;though he did not expect to cure me. He commenced to treat me,
and in about one month I began to improve, though very slowly. This was in
February, 1891, and before the end of the year I was able to walk down
stairs again. It was in March, 1892, that I began taking Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677"

your treatment, and use a battery as well, which I did until April, 1893,
when I could walk about quite nicely, and I now enjoy better health than
for the past eight years. I am thankful too, that my eldest daughter has
derived the greatest benefit from Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription. She
took it for painful menstruation, and is now well and healthy. I am</p>

Pa., (who has been a terrible invalid and was cured at your Institute), for
advice. 'Oh, father,' she said, 'don't doctor here, but go to Dr. Pierce.
So the result was I gave her money and she sent for medicines. You sent two
bottles of medicine and he never has taken a drop since and is perfectly
well and never had a spell since. I do not know what you call the disease,
but we called it spasms or fits. With my experience I can heartily
recommend the Invalids' Hotel, and think if a case can be cured at all, you
can cure it. And unless they can cure or greatly benefit the patient, they
will not undertake it; this is my experience with the World's Dispensary.
My daughter, Mrs. D.T. Knappenberger, and my son Johnnie, feel very
grateful toward the Dispensary for their cure.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;My little girl was delicate from birth, nervous and
irritable. When three and one-half years old we discovered she had that
terrible disease "epilepsy," inherited from her father's family; she had
spasms or fits once in two or three days, and grew worse so rapidly that in
four months she had from four to eight fits in twenty-four hours. Home
physicians did no good, and just then one of your little pamphlets came to
me as they had come often before. As my need was great I wrote a
description of her case, and though your answer did not seem very
encouraging, I did not dare to lose any chance of saving my child, so I
commenced the treatment. On November 6, 1891, she had seven fits; November
7th gave her your medicines; she had four fits that day, and never one
since. She took your medicines less than four months. She is nearly six
years old, a strong, hearty, bright child, attending school every day.</p>

<p>What more can I say than that I thank Dr. Pierce and the Faculty of the
World's Dispensary Medical Association for having saved the life of my
child, and I thank God that he gave them the knowledge and skill to do
so.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;My boy had been in bad health for a long time. We
called our home doctor, but he got no better. Finally he had the St.
Vitus's Dance, and our doctor did not know what to do. So I wrote to you
and did as you told me; I got two bottles of your "Favorite Prescription,"
and one bottle and a half did the work all right. At that time, eighteen
months ago, his weight was 85 pounds, now it is 135 to 140; he is fourteen
years old.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;My daughter, Josephine E. Thulin, is now six and a
half years old. She had been afflicted with epilepsy for three and a half
years, and received treatment from three different doctors, and from one
especially, for the space of two years steady, without any benefit. Before
taking your treatment she had as many as six or seven spells a day. The
child could not have stood it much longer. After taking your treatment one
month the spells stopped. With four months' special treatment from you, and
two months' use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription she was entirely
cured. In one year and three months she has not had a drop of medicine, and
she is in the best of health and vigor.</p>

<p>I would say to any sufferer from obstinate or chronic disease, and
especially epilepsy, that we have a living witness. You can come and see

<p><i>To whom it may concern</i>:</p>

<p>This is to certify that I took treatment at the Invalids' Hotel and
Surgical Institute, Buffalo, N.Y., and I was cured of a chronic trouble
that had been maltreated by other physicians. While there I saw a man who
had been cured by the specialists, who had before been given up to die by
the best doctors in Troy, N.Y. Of course, the case must have been a very
stubborn one. I afterwards saw a man here, in Georgia, die, who, if he had
been in Pierce's Surgical Institute under the treatment and care of his
skilled doctors and nurses, I know would have most assuredly got well. Why?
Because it was only a case of <i>stone in the bladder</i>, and they are
easily cured at Dr. Pierce's Surgical Institute. I think almost any chronic
disease can be cured there, if taken in time, judging from my observations
while an inmate of that Institution.</p>

<p>Without solicitude or hope of pecuniary reward, with heart-felt
gratitude and a desire to aid my fellow-man to health and happiness, allow
me to state, that as an inmate for more than a month of the Invalids' Hotel
and Surgical Institute at No. 663 Main Street, Buffalo, N.Y., I feel
warranted in its highest recommendation. While there I saw and talked with
a groat number of people who came there as a last resort, to be cured of
almost every chronic disease to which flesh is heir, and they were
unanimous in their praise of the Institution and the skilled specialists
who constitute its professional staff.</p>
